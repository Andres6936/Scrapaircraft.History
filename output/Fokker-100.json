  "history": "Fokker's largest aircraft, the Fokker 100 is a 100 seat jet airliner based on the F-28 Fellowship, but stretched and thoroughly modernised. Fokker announced it was developing the Fokker 100 simultaneously with the Fokker 50 turboprop in November 1983. The Fokker 100 is based on the basic F-28 airframe, with the most important and obvious change being the stretched fuselage, increasing maximum seating to 122, compared with 85 in the F-28-4000 (on which the 100 is based). Other changes include more economical RollsRoyce Tay turbofans (which, unlike the F-28's Speys, conform to Stage 3 noise limits), revised wing design with greater span and aerodynamic efficiency (Fokker claimed it to be 30% more efficient than the F-28's), a modern EFIS glass flightdeck, redesigned cabin interior plus other systems and numerous equipment changes. The Fokker 100's first flight occurred on November 30 1986, certification was awarded in November 1987 and the first customer delivery, to Swissair, occurred in February 1988. The Fokker 100 was offered in a number of versions including higher gross weight options of the standard airliner, the Fokker 100QC Quick change airliner or freighter with a large forward freight door and the Fokker Executive Jet 100 corporate shuttle or VIP transport, fitted with luxury interiors to customer requirements. It also forms the basis for the shorter Fokker 70, while the 130 seat class Fokker 130 had also been studied. Fokker collapsed in 1996 and wound up production early the following year. Rekkof (Fokker backwards) Restart has been negotiating to re-open the Fokker 70 and 100 lines.",
