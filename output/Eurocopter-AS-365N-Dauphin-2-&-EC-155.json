  "history": "The (originally Aerospatiale) AS-365N Dauphin 2 is one of Eurocopter's most successful designs and has found widespread use in corporate, police, media, EMS and search and rescue roles worldwide. The AS-365N is a much improved development of the original SA-365C Dauphin 2 (described under Aerospatiale). Until January 1990 the AS-365 models were designated SA-365, and in 1992 Aerospatiale's helicopter division was incorporated into Eurocopter. The AS-356N introduced more powerful Arriel 1C turboshafts, enlarged tail surfaces, revised transmission, main rotor, rotor mast fairing and engine cowling, and retractable tricycle undercarriage. The AS-365N first flew on March 31 1979. Deliveries began in early 1982. The US Coast Guard took delivery of 99 HH-65A Dolphins (SA-366G-1). These aircraft are powered by Textron (Avco) Lycoming LTS-101s and are optimised for the USCG's search and rescue role. Deliveries of the improved AS-365N-2 commenced in 1990. It features upgraded Arriel 1C2 engines, improved gearbox, increased max takeoff weight, redesigned cabin doors, revised interior and optional EFIS instrumentation. The AS-365N-3 is a hot and high development with FADEC equipped Arriel 2Cs. Deliveries began in December 1998. The improved EC-155 (initially AS-365N-4) development was announced at the 1997 Paris Airshow. It features twin Arriel 2Cs equipped with FADEC, a five blade Spheriflex main rotor and a 40% larger main cabin, achieved with bulged doors. First flight was on June 17 1997, with French and German certification awarded in December 1998. Military AS-365Ns have been offered as AS-565 Panthers. Utility versions are the AS-565UA/UB, attack versions are the AS-565AA/AB, while the AS-565MA/MB are equipped for naval search and rescue, and the AS-565SA/SB for ASW (Anti Submarine Warfare) duties.",
