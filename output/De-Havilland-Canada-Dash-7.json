  "history": "Despite being out of production for some years now, the four engine de Havilland Canada Dash 7 remains unrivalled because of its impressive STOL and low noise capabilities. The Dash 7 (or DHC7) was designed as a STOL (short takeoff and landing) 50 seat regional airliner capable of operating from strips as short as 915m (3000ft) in length. The main design features to achieve such a capability were an advanced wing and four Pratt & Whitney PT6A turboprops. Double slotted trailing edge flaps run the entire span of the high mounted wing, dramatically increasing the lifting surface available for takeoff. Extra lift is also generated by the airflow over the wing from the relatively slow turning propellers. The wings also feature two pairs of spoilers each - the inboard pair also operate as lift dumpers, the outboard pair can act differentially in conjunction with the ailerons to boost roll control. Financial backing from the Canadian Government allowed the launch of the DHC7 program in the early 1970s, resulting in the maiden flight of the first of two development aircraft on March 27 1975. The first production Dash 7 flew on March 3 1977, the type was certificated on May 2 1977 and it entered service with Rocky Mountain Airways on February 3 1978. The standard passenger carrying Dash 7 is the Series 100, while the type was also offered in pure freighter form as the Series 101. The only major development of the Dash 7 was the Series 150, which featured a higher max takeoff weight and greater fuel capacity, boosting range. The Series 151 was the equivalent freighter. Production of the Dash 7 ended in 1988, following Boeing's takeover of de Havilland Canada.",
