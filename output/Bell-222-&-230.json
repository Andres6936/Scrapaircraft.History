  "history": "Bell announced development of the all new 222 twin in 1974, following the positive response generated by a mockup proposal displayed at that year's Helicopter Association of America convention. Having taken note of potential customers' preferences and suggestions, Bell modified its design accordingly, and the subsequent development effort led to the Model 222's first flight in August 1976. A number of advanced features were designed into the 222, including the Noda Matic vibration reduction system developed for the 214ST, stub wings housing the retractable undercarriage, provision for IFR avionics, and dual hydraulic and electrical systems. The 222 was awarded FAA certification in December 1979. Production deliveries commenced in early 1980. Subsequent development led to the more powerful 222B with a larger diameter main rotor, introduced in 1982, and the essentially similar 222UT Utility Twin, which features skid landing gear in place of wheels. The Bell 230 is a development of the 222 with two Allison 250 turboshafts instead of the 222's LTS 101s plus other refinements. First flight of a 230, a converted 222, took place on August 12 1991, and Transport Canada certification was awarded in March 1992. The first delivery of a production 230 occurred that November and customers had a choice of skid or wheel undercarriage. Production ceased in 1995. The 230 has been replaced by the stretched, more powerful 430, described separately.",
