  "history": "The most successful six place light twin since its introduction, the Seneca is a twin engine development of the Cherokee Six. Seneca development began when Piper flew a converted trimotor Cherokee Six, designated PA-32-3M, fitted with two additional 85kW (115hp) Lycomings O-235 on either wing. The subsequent twin engine prototype PA-34-180 Twin 6 first flew with two 135kW (180hp) Lycomings, while the definitive standard third Seneca prototype, the PA-34-200 Twin 6, first flew in October 1969 with fuel injected 150kW (200hp) IO-360s. Production deliveries of the initial PA-34-200 Seneca began in late 1971. Handling and performance criticisms were addressed from the 1974 model year with the PA-34-200T Seneca II which introduced changes to the flight controls and, more importantly, two turbocharged Continental TSIO-360-Es. Piper originally planned that the follow-on PA-34-220T Seneca III would feature a T-tail, but these plans were dropped and the main changes introduced were counter rotating 165kW (220hp) TSIO-360s and a revised interior and instrument panel. Introduced in 1981, the Seneca III was replaced by New Piper's improved PA-34-220T Seneca IV in 1994 with aerodynamic refinements, axisymetric engine inlets and a revised interior. The current PA-34-220T Seneca V was introduced in January 1997. It features intercooled turbocharged L/TSIO-360-RB engines which maintain rated power to 19,500ft, and seating for five, with a standard entertainment/executive workstation with extendable worktable and optional phone/fax. A sixth seat in place of the workstation is optional. The Seneca was also built or assembled by other manufacturers, AICSA in Colombia, Chincul in Argentina (as the PA-A-34), Embraer in Brazil (as the EMB-810), and PZL-Mielec in Poland (as the M-20 Mewa, partly with PZL/Franklin engines). Conversions are made by Seguin as the Princess, and by Robertson as the Super Seneca I and II.",
