  "history": "The single engine SA-360 Dauphin and twin engine SA-365C Dauphin 2 were developed as replacements for the Alouette III. The prototype SA-360 first flew on June 2 1972 and was powered by a 730kW (980shp) Turbom\u00e9ca Astazou XVI turboshaft. After 180 development flights a more powerful 785kW (1050shp) Astazou XVIIIA was substituted, and weights were fitted to the rotor tips to reduce vibration and to eliminate ground resonance. The first prototype flew in this new configuration on May 4 1973, following a second prototype built to the new standard which had flown for the first time that January. The first production aircraft, designated the SA-360C, flew in April 1975. The SA-361 is a more powerful variant with improved hot and high performance and a greater payload capability. Although prototypes were built, the SA-361 was not taken into production. A military variant of the SA-361, the SA-361H, was offered fitted with up to eight HOT anti tank missiles, but was also not ordered into production. The twin engine SA-365C Dauphin 2 meanwhile was announced in early 1973. First flight was on January 24 1975. It features twin Arriel turboshafts and a new engine fairing, a Starflex main rotor hub and a higher max takeoff weight. Production deliveries began in December 1978. SA-360 and SA-365C production ceased in 1981 in preference for the much improved SA-365N (later AS-365N), described under Eurocopter.",

  "production": "Production of the SA-360, SA-361 and SA-365C ceased in 1981. Approx 40 SA-360s and 50 SA-365Cs built."
