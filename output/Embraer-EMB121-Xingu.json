  "history": "The sleek looking Xingu coupled the Bandeirante's wing and engines with an all new fuselage, but was only produced in modest numbers. The Xingu flew for the first time on October 10 1976, with a production aircraft following on May 20 1977. The first customer delivery occurred later that same year (to the CopersucarFittipaldi Formula One racing team). The major customer for the Xingu I was the French military, with a total order for 41 (for aircrew training and liaison duties for the air force and navy), which accounted for almost half of all EMB121 production. Several derivatives of the Xingu design were proposed, including the original EMB120, the Araguia, a commuter airliner which would have seated 25, and the EMB123 Tapaj\u00f3s. The Tapaj\u00f3s would have had more powerful 835kW (1120shp) PT6A45 engines (which also would have powered the Araguia), increased wing span and a lengthened fuselage. A more modest development did enter production, the EMB121B Xingu II. This introduced more powerful engines, four blade props, increased fuel tankage and greater seating capacity courtesy of a slightly stretched fuselage. Similar in size, powerplant and performance to the Raytheon Beech King Air B200, the Xingu II made its first flight on September 4 1981. Production ceased in August 1987 after 105 had been built.",
