  "history": "Partenavia developed the P.68 as a multirole low maintenance and aerodynamically efficient twin capable of performing a number of utility roles. The resulting P.68 Victor first flew on May 25 1970 and demonstrated performance similar to that of aircraft in its class (such as the Seneca) which had retractable undercarriage, but without the added weight and complexity of retractable gear. The high wing design also incorporated a large degree of glass fibre reinforced plastic construction in non load bearing areas. Thirteen preproduction P.68As were built between 1971 and 1973 before improved production standard P.68Bs, with a longer cabin, increased takeoff weight and redesigned instrument panel, were delivered from 1974. A retractable undercarriage variant, the P.68R, was trialled over 1976/77 but did not enter production. The P.68C replaced the B in 1979 and introduced a longer nose to house weather radar and more avionics, extra fuel, revised cabin interior and redesigned wheel fairings. The turbocharged TC was introduced in 1980 and features two turbocharged 157kW (210hp) TIO360s. Observer versions of both the P.68B and P.68C have been built, these featuring a clear nose section for helicopterlike visibility. A turboprop development, the AT.68TP300 Spartacus, first flew in 1978, and led to the larger AP.68TP Viator, which is in Italian government service.",
