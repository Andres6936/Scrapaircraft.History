  "history": "Built in greater numbers than any other Russian helicopter, the Mi-8/Mi-17 series (NATO codename \"Hip\") was designed primarily as a military transport, but is also in widespread civil use. The Mi-8 was designed as a replacement for the piston engined Mi-4, with design work beginning in May 1960. First flight of the prototype (powered by a single Soloviev turboshaft driving a four blade main rotor) occurred in June 1961, while a production standard Mi-8 flew in August 1962 and production began shortly afterwards. Versions of the Mi-8 built for civil use have square windows and include the Mi-8P passenger version, Mi-8T utility transport, Mi-8TM upgraded passenger transport with weather radar and Mi-8S Salon executive transport. Production of the Mi-8 ceased in favour of the re-engined Mi-17, which was first publicly revealed to the west at the 1981 Paris Airshow. The Mi-17 introduced TV3 turboshafts and the tail rotor was relocated to the port side of the tailboom. Civil versions include the base Mi-17, and the essentially similar Mi-17-1 and Mi-17M, which both feature more powerful TV3-117VM turboshafts, and are built by Ulan Ude Aviation and Kazan Helicopters respectively. Both have been actively marketed in the west. The Kazan/Mil developed Mi-17KF Kittiwake is designed to meet western certification standards and features an EFIS instrument panel with colour displays, designed and integrated by Kelowna Flightcraft in Canada, rounded \"dolphin\" nose with space for radar, and a rear loading ramp in place of the clamshell doors. The latter two features are also incorporated on the Kazan/Mil Mi-17MD and Mi-17N.",
