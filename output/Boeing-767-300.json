  "history": "Boeing announced that it was developing a stretched development of the 767-200 in February 1982. The resulting 767-300 features a 6.42m (21ft 1in) stretch consisting of fuselage plugs forward (3.07m/10ft 1in) and behind (3.35m/11ft) the wing centre section. The flightdeck and systems were carried directly over from the 767-200, the only other changes were minor, and related to the increased weights of the new version. Initially the max takeoff weight was the same as the later 767-200ER. The 767-300 flew for the first time on January 30 1986, and was awarded certification and entered service in September that year. The higher weight Extended Range ER version flew on December 19 1986, while RollsRoyce RB-211-524G engines became available from 1989. The range of the 767-300ER has proven to be very popular with a number of airlines using them for long range low density flights. In 1993 Boeing launched the 767-300F General Market Freighter. Changes include strengthened undercarriage and wing structure, a cargo handling system, no cabin windows and a main deck freight door. Capacity is 24 containers. The further stretched 767-400 is described separately.",
