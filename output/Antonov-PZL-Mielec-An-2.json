  "history": "The An-2 was originally designed to meet a USSR Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry requirement, and flew for the first time on August 31 1947. Entering production and service the following year, Antonov built An-2s were powered by 745kW (1000hp) ASh62 radials. Soviet production continued through to the mid sixties by which time a number of variants had been developed, including the base model An-2P, An-2S and 2M crop sprayers, An-2VA water bomber, An-2M floatplane and the An-2ZA high altitude meteorological research aircraft. Production responsibility was transferred to Poland's PZL Mielec in the 1960s, with the first example flying on October 23 1960. Aside from the An-2P, Polish versions include the An-2PK VIP transport, An-2PR for TV relay work, An-2S ambulance, An-2TD paratroop transport, An-2P cargo/passenger version, An-2 Geofiz geophysical survey version, passenger An-2T and An-2TP, and agricultural An-2R. Chinese production as the Y5 commenced with Nanchang in 1957, before being transferred to the Shijiazhuang Aircraft Manufacturing Company. The main Chinese version is the standard Y5N, while the latest development is the Y5B specialist ag aircraft, which first flew in June 1989. An Antonov built turboprop powered version, the An-3, flew in prototype form in the early 1980s powered by a 706kW (946shp) Omsk (Mars) TVD10, but did not enter production.",
  "name": "Antonov/PZL Mielec An-2",
  "production": "More than 5000 An-2s were built in the Ukraine between 1948 and the mid 1960s, before production was transferred to PZL Mielec in Poland, where approximately 12,000 have been built and low rate production continues. Close to 1000 Y5s have been built by SAMC in China."
