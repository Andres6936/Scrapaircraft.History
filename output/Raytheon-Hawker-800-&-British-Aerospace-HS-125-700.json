  "history": "The HS-125-700 and Hawker 800 are two more recent versions of the world's longest running corporate jet production program. The 125-700 and Hawker 800 are direct developments of the DH-125 (later the HS-125), which first flew in August 1962. This aircraft was developed into a number of variants through to the HS-125-600, all of which are powered by the RollsRoyce Viper turbojet and are described separately under Hawker Siddeley. The introduction of the HS-125-700 in 1976 brought with it significant performance and fuel economy benefits as the -700 incorporated Garrett TFE-731 turbofans. The 125-700 first flew on June 19 1976, and the model remained in production until it was replaced by the 125-800 in 1984. The 125-800 first flew on May 26 1983 and it introduced a number of improvements. Aerodynamic changes included a reprofiled nose and windscreen, extended fin leading edge, and greater span wing which decreased drag and increased lift and fuel capacity. Range was boosted further by a larger ventral fuel tank. More powerful TFE-731s improved field performance, while a redesigned interior made more efficient use of the space available. The 800 was also the first corporate jet to feature an EFIS cockpit and is now available with the Collins Pro Line 21 avionics suite. The 800A was specifically aimed at the US market, the 800B for non US markets. The 125-800 became the Hawker 800 from mid 1993 when Raytheon purchased BAe's Corporate Jets division. Production has been transferred to Wichita in the USA (the first US built 800 flew on November 5 1996, the last UK built 800 on April 29 1997). Current production is of the 800XP (Extended Performance) which was certificated in 1995 and has improved engines for better climb and cruise performance. A new interior is being introduced in 1999.",
