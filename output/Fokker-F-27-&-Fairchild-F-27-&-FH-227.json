  "history": "Probably the closest to being the fabled DC-3 replacement, the Fokker F-27 Friendship, including the Fairchild built F-27 and FH-227, was built in greater numbers than any other western turboprop airliner. The Fokker F-27 began life as a 1950 design study known as the P275, a 32 seater powered by two RollsRoyce Dart turboprops. With the aid of Dutch government funding the P275 evolved into the F-27, which first flew on November 24 1955. This original prototype was powered by Dart 507s and would have seated 28, by the time the second prototype had flown (in January 1957) the fuselage length grew to allow seating for 32. By this stage Fokker had signed an agreement that would see Fairchild build Friendships in the USA. The first aircraft to enter service was in fact a Fairchild built F-27, in September 1958. Fairchild F-27s differed from the initial Fokker F-27 Mk 100s in having basic seating for 40, a lengthened nose capable of housing a weather radar, and additional fuel capacity. Developments included the Mk 200/F-27A with more powerful engines, Mk 300/F-27B and primarily military Mk 400 Combi versions, the Mk 500 with a 1.50m (4ft 11in) fuselage stretch taking seating to 52, and Mk 600 quick change freight/pax aircraft. Fairchild independently developed the stretched FH-227, which appeared almost two years earlier than the Mk 500. The FH-227 featured a 1.83m (6ft 0in) stretch over standard length F-27/F-27s, taking standard seating to 52.",
