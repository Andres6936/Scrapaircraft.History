  "history": "When released, the Cessna 340 joined the Beechcraft Duke as the only other six seat pressurised piston twin from a major manufacturer, positioned in Cessna's product line between the 310 and the eight seat 414 and 421. Development of the 340 began in 1969, but the loss of the prototype early in 1970 set back the development program so that production deliveries did not begin until early 1971. The resulting aircraft borrowed heavily from other Cessna twins of the time including the wings from the 414 and the 310's undercarriage and a similar tail unit. Design features of the new aircraft included a pressurisation system with a differential of 0.29bars (4.2psi) that kept the cabin's internal altitude at 8000ft while the aircraft was at 20,000ft, an all new fail safe fuselage and an integral airstair door. Initial production 340s were powered by two 210kW (285hp) turbocharged Continental TSIO-520-K engines, but these were replaced on the improved 340A, which was first introduced in 1976. Power for the 340A was supplied by two 230kW (310hp) TSIO-520-NBs, while other improvements included reduced diameter props and a slight increase in weights. The 340A was offered in optional 340A II and 340A III forms with various levels of IFR avionics fitted. The Cessna 335 is an unpressurised, lighter weight and thus lower cost development of the 340. Available from 1979, aside from being unpressurised it differed in having 225kW (300hp) TSIO-520-EB engines. Although claimed by Cessna as the lowest priced cabin class business twin on the market, just 64 335s were built before production was terminated in 1980. Production of the 340 continued until 1984.",
