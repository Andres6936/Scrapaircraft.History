  "history": "The Bell Model 204B and 205A1 are the civil counterparts to the highly successful UH1B and UH1H Iroquois military helicopters. Bell designed the Model 204 in response to a 1955 US Army requirement for a multi-purpose utility helicopter. The 204 was something of a quantum leap forward in helicopter design as it was one of the first to be powered by a turboshaft. The turboshaft engine radically improved the practicality of the helicopter because of its lower maintenance and operating costs, lower fuel consumption, light weight and high power to weight ratio. The use of a turboshaft in the 204 allowed it to carry a useful payload over respectable ranges and at reasonable speeds, which resulted in the 204 and 205 becoming the most successful western helicopter series in terms of numbers built. The UH1B, from which the 204B was derived, was first delivered March 1961. The subsequent Model 205A1 is based on the UH1H, which, when compared to the B model, is greater in length and capacity, has better performance and a more powerful engine. In civil guise the 204 and 205 have been operated in a number of utility roles including aerial cranes and firebombing. The 214A & C were developed for Iran from the 214 Huey Plus (an improved version of the 205), powered by a massive 2185kW (2930shp) Lycoming LTC4B-8D (with more than twice the power of the 205's T53). Iran's Army took delivery of 287 214A Isfahan troop carrier and supply transport helicopters during the 1970s, while another 39 were delivered as 214C SAR helicopters. A commercial derivative, the 214B BigLifter, powered by a 1185kW (2930shp) Lycoming T5508D turboshaft, was built in smaller numbers for civil customers through to 1981. Its main use is as an aerial crane.",
