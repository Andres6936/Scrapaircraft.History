  "history": "The Brantly B2 series of light helicopters first flew in the early 1950s and returned to production in the early 1990s, while the larger five seat 305 dates to the early 1970s. <p>The original B2 two seat light helicopter was designed and built by Mr N Brantly, and flew for the first time on February 21 1953. Certification was awarded in April 1959 allowing production deliveries to get underway soon after. The initial production B2 model featured a 135kW (180hp) VO360A1A flat four, the same basic powerplant that powered the B2 series through to the 1990s. The initial B2 was followed by the improved B2A with a redesigned cabin and the B2B, which became the definitive production model. <p>Brantly also developed a larger five seat Model 305 based on the B2, with a larger cabin and more powerful VO540 engine. The 305 first flew in January 1964 and was certificated in July the following year. <p>Brantly production ceased in the early 1970s after more than 400 B2s had been built. However production resumed in 1976 when the Hynes company acquired the design and production rights to what became the BrantlyHynes B2 and 305. <p>BrantlyHynes continued low rate manufacture of both models through to the mid 1980s when it too ceased production. Finally in 1989 James Kimura formed Brantly Helicopter Industries to build both models, and low rate production resumed for a time. By 1998 the Chinese backed Brantly International Inc had resumed low rate B2B production at Vernon, Texas. <p>",
