  "history": "The Gulfstream G200 mid size corporate jet is built by Israel Aircraft Industries and was originally marketed and supported by subsidiary Galaxy Aerospace Inc, which was acquired by Gulfstream in May 2001. Design work on the IAI-1126 Galaxy (initially called the Astra Galaxy and later renamed G200 on Gulfstream's take-over) began in the early 1990s and formal program launch was announced in September 1993. In 1995 a co-production arrangement was terminated that would have seen Yakovlev in Russia responsible for the design and manufacture of the Galaxy's fuselage, while IAI would be the main contractor responsible for final assembly, integration and marketing. Subsequently SOGERMA of France was selected to manufacture production Galaxy fuselages and tails. The Galaxy was first expected to fly in 1996 but this was delayed until December 25 1997. A second prototype flew in May 1998 while the first production aircraft first flew in October that year. US FAA and Israeli certification was issued in December 1998. The first customer aircraft was delivered to TTI Industries in January 2000 (a Galaxy delivered to Lion Industries in Zurich in July 1999 was leased back by Galaxy Aerospace for use as a demonstrator). IAI assembles and test flies Galaxies in Israel while interior completion takes place at Galaxy Aerospace's new facilities in Fort Worth, Texas. The Galaxy features a wing design based on the swept high speed unit of the Astra, but otherwise is a completely new design. It features a new \"widebody\" fuselage, significantly wider and longer than the Astra's, with standup room. The rear fuselage is area ruled to reduce drag, while the wing features winglets. The Galaxy also features an EFIS Collins Pro Line 4 cockpit and nonstop trans Atlantic and one stop trans Pacific range. IAI selected the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW-306A turbofans for the Galaxy in January 1993 after studying competing designs from Allison (the AE-3007) and AlliedSignal/General Electric (the CFE-738). The PW-306A is a growth development (with increased fan diameter, improved hot end material and a forced mixer in the exhaust) of the PW-305 series that powers the Hawker 1000 and Learjet 60. In June 2001, Galaxy Aerospace was acquired by Gulfstream Aerospace, who now owns the type certificate and is responsible for further development and engineering support. The Galaxy was renamed Gulfstream G200 at the same time. Israel Aircraft Industries continues to build and test fly the aircraft in Israel at its Tel Aviv facilities, which are then flown \"green\" to Gulfstream's completion center at Dallas Love Field airport in Texas, where interiors and optional equipment are installed (before Gulfstream's acquisition of the project, Galaxy Aerospace undertook completions and deliveries from a new facility at Alliance Airport, Fort Worth, Texas). Some orders announced by Gulfstream: 50 plus an option on another 50 for Executive Jets, 24 plus an option on 43 for Avolar, and 3 for Hainan Airlines.",
