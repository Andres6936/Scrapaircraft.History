  "history": "The turboprop powered developments of the Aero Commander family of light twins enjoyed a two decade long production run, and were built by three companies before production ceased. The original Turboprop Commander was based on the 680FLP, and first flew on December 31 1964, but instead of piston engines power was supplied by 450kW (605shp) Garrett AiResearch TPE331 turboprops. This initial Turbo Commander model was designated the 680T and entered production in 1965. Progressively improved developments of the basic Turbo Commander appeared, including the 680V, which introduced an increased maximum takeoff weight, and the 680W with improved engines. Following North American Rockwell's takeover of Aero Commander and the introduction of the further improved Model 681, the name Hawk Commander was adopted for a time, but it was dropped from 1971 with the release of the 681B. By the time of the introduction of the 681B, Rockwell was already flight testing the upgraded Turbo Commander 690, which first flew on March 3 1968 and was certificated in July 1971. Rockwell introduced the improved 690A soon after. In 1979 Rockwell flew the Jetprop Commander 840 and 980, developments of the 690 powered by 625kW (840shp) Garrett TPE3315 and 730kW (980shp) TPE33110 turboprops respectively. These went into production with Gulfstream, who had purchased Rockwell's GA lines in 1979. The Jetprop 1000 was similar in overall dimensions but introduced a revised interior that made better use of the available space and the 980's engines. The Jetprop 900 meanwhile combined the revised interior with the 840's engines.",
