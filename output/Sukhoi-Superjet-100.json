  "history": "The Superjet 100 design was launched in 2000, with the aim being to produce a modern regional airliner for the traditional Eastern European/CIS markets. It is also intended to be attractive to Western customers due to lower purchase and operating costs than competing Western designs, but with the required safety and performance features that were often perceived as lacking in older designs from the Soviet era, preventing sales to that market. Sukhoi worked with new partners, notably including Boeing, as they developed the aircraft for the post-Cold War airline environment. The aircraft that emerged is modern and targeted to compete with close competitors such as the Embraer ERJ-190/195 and Bombardier designs, as well as the smaller Airbus and Boeing designs such as the A318 and 737-600. Development was more protracted than expected, but successful, with the first of four prototypes flying on 19 May 2008. Certification was reasonably straightforward, with a few problems requiring attention, particularly with the new engines. Customer deliveries began in 2011 when Armenian airline Armavia took delivery of the first production aircraft, with Aeroflot taking its first aircraft later the same year.",
