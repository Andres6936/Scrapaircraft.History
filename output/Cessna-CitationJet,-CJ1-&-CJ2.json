  "history": "The highly successful CitationJet was developed as a replacement for the Citation and Citation I. Improved and stretched developments, the CJ1 and CJ2 respectively, are under development. Cessna launched the new Model 525 CitationJet at the annual US National Business Aircraft Association convention in 1989. First flight occurred on April 29 1991, FAA certification was awarded on October 16 1992 and the first delivery was on March 30 1993. The CitationJet is effectively an all new aircraft. The same basic Citation forward fuselage is mounted to a new T-tail configured tailplane and a new supercritical laminar flow wing, and it features Williams Rolls FJ44 turbofans (with paddle thrust reversers) and trailing link main undercarriage. The CitationJet's fuselage is 27cm (11in) shorter than the Citation/Citation I's, while cabin height is increased courtesy of a lowered centre aisle. It features EFIS avionics and is certificated for single pilot operation. At the 1998 NBAA convention Cessna revealed it was developing the improved CJ1 and stretched CJ2. The CJ1 will replace the CitationJet and will introduce a Collins Pro Line 21 EFIS avionics suite and a moderate increase in maximum takeoff weight. The CJ1 will be delivered from the first quarter of 2000. The CJ2 meanwhile is a stretched, faster and more powerful development. Due to fly in the second quarter of 1999 and be certificated 12 months later, the CJ2 will feature a 89cm (35in) cabin and 43cm (17in) tailcone stretch allowing standard seating for six in the main cabin. Like the CJ1 it will feature Collins Pro Line 21 EFIS avionics, plus uprated FJ44-2C engines, increased span wings, larger area tail, six cabin windows per side and greater range. It will be certificated for single pilot operation.",
