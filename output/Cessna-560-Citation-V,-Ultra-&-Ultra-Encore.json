  "history": "The Citation V, Citation Ultra and Ultra Encore are the largest straight wing members of Cessna's highly successful Citation family. Cessna publicly announced it was developing a stretched development of the Citation II at the annual NBAA convention in New Orleans in 1987. Earlier in August that year the first engineering prototype Model 560 Citation V had successfully completed the type's maiden flight. A preproduction prototype flew in early 1986, while US certification was granted on December 9 1988. Deliveries began the following April. The Citation V was based on the Citation II/SP, but differences over the smaller jet include more powerful Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D5A turbofans and a slight fuselage stretch, allowing seating in a standard configuration for eight passengers. The Citation V proved quite popular, with 262 built through to mid 1994 before production switched to the modernised Ultra. Cessna announced development of the upgraded Citation V Ultra in September 1993. FAA certification was granted in June 1994, allowing for deliveries of production aircraft to commence soon after. Compared with the Citation V, the Ultra features more powerful 13.6kN (3045lb) Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D5D engines and Honeywell Primus 1000 EFIS avionics with three CRT displays (two primary flight displays and one multifunction display). The Citation Ultra Encore is a new development announced at the 1998 NBAA convention. Compared with the Ultra the Encore introduces new Pratt & Whitney Canada PW535 engines, plus trailing link main undercarriage, more fuel payload, updated interior and improved systems. The Ultra's Honeywell Primus 1000 EFIS avionics suite is retained. International Directory of Civil Aircraft",
