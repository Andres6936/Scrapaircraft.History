  "history": "The 411 was Cessna's entry into the eight seat cabin class twin market that had previously been dominated by the Beech Queen Air. Much more modern than the Queen Air, the 411 was lighter, smaller and faster. The prototype first flew in July 1962 and differed from the following production aircraft in having two blade props and direct drive engines (as opposed to the geared GTSIO-520-C engines of production aircraft). Production deliveries commenced in October 1964. Optional features for corporate configured aircraft included folding tables, a toilet and refreshment centre. The 411 was followed up by the 411A from 1967 with lighter and more efficient props and optional extra fuel capacity. The 411 was soon after replaced by the 401 and 402, which had first been introduced in late 1966. These developments of the 411 were lighter, less powerful and had direct drive engines, and thus were less costly to operate. While the 401 and 402 were essentially the same aircraft, the 401 was optimised for corporate transport and was fitted with fewer seats than the 402, which was configured for commuter and freighter work. A number of versions of both models were developed with minor refinements, including the 402A, which had a lengthened nose, square windows and an optional 10th seat. The 402 replaced the 401 from mid 1972, and, as the 402B, was offered in Businessliner corporate configuration, and Utililiner convertible passenger or freighter aircraft. The 402C appeared in late 1978 and featured the longer span wings from the 414A and 421C and more powerful engines. It remained in production until 1985.",
