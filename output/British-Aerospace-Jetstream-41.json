  "history": "The Jetstream 41 is a stretched and modernised development of the 19 seat Jetstream 31, designed to compete in the 29 seat commuter airliner class alongside such types as the Brasilia, Dornier 328 and Saab 340. The Jetstream 41 (or J41) is based on the J31, but features a 4.88m (16ft) fuselage stretch, consisting of a 2.51m (8ft 3in) plug forward of the wing and a 2.36m (7ft 9in) stretch rear. The increased span wing (with reworked ailerons and flaps) is mounted lower on the fuselage so that it does not carry through the fuselage and interrupt the interior cabin aisle, unlike on the Jetstream 31. Other airframe modifications included a new reprofiled six piece windscreen and extended wing root fairing with greater baggage capacity. More powerful AlliedSignal TPE331 turboprops, mounted in new nacelles with increased ground clearance, drive advanced five blade McCauley propellers. The flightdeck has modern EFIS glass displays. Development work on the J41 was announced in mid 1989, resulting in the type's first flight on September 25 1991. Three further aircraft were also used in the flight test program, with European JAA certification being awarded on November 23 1992. The first delivery occurred two days later on November 25. From mid 1994, all aircraft delivered benefited from various payload and range performance improvements, resulting from uprated engines and a higher maximum takeoff weight. The J41 was initially known as the BAe Jetstream 41, but BAe's establishment of a separate Jetstream Aircraft division in mid 1993 saw the name simplified to just Jetstream 41. From January 1996 the J41 became part of the Aero International (Regional) stable, but in May 1997 BAe announced that it was terminating J41 production. Field Aircraft of the UK and Pilatus of Switzerland were risk sharing partners, while Gulfstream was to build 200 wingsets.",
