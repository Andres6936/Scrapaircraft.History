  "history": "Kestrel's K250 (previously KL-1A) is an all new, composite construction entry into the four place light aircraft market, and in its base K250A form will be an almost direct competitor to Cessna's new 172R. <p>Oklahoma based Kestrel was founded by a former Cessna sales manager Donald L Stroud in 1991. The K250A is its first aircraft, with a family of developments of the basic aircraft to follow. The K-250A's basic price was expected to be around $US90,000, considerably cheaper than other new build four seaters. <p>The prototype KL1A/K-250A was rolled out on April 21 1995, with first flight occurring later that same year, on November 19. Certification to FAR Part 23 in utility and normal categories is planned. <p>A key design feature of the basic K-250A is its graphite composite construction fuselage, while power is from a 120kW (160hp) Textron Lycoming O320 flat four driving a two blade prop. <p>The K250A is due to be followed by a family of developments, offering greater performance and/or capacity. The K250B will be powered by a 140kW (190hp) fuel injected Textron Lycoming IO360ES driving a three blade constant speed propeller. The K250R will be similarly powered but compared with the K250B will have retractable undercarriage. The high performance K-250C will also feature a three blade prop, but power will be from a 170kW (230hp) Textron Lycoming IO540. <p>At the top of the planned family tree will be the six seat utility K250D, which will feature a Textron Lycoming TSIO550B derated to 240kW (325hp) driving a three blade constant speed propeller. <p>Kestrel has also proposed a military observation/forward air control variant of the K250A, which would feature a pylon under each wing for light weapons and additional observation windows. <p>",
