  "history": "The renowned Zlin series of two seat Trener trainers and single seat Akrobat aerobatic aircraft was a great success, winning numerous world aerobatic championship titles during the 1960s. The original Z 26 Trener was designed in response to a Czechoslovak government requirement for a two seat basic trainer for flying school and military use. The Z 26 was powered by a 78kW (105hp) Walter Minor 4III inline four cylinder engine, featured wooden construction and a fixed taildragger undercarriage. The prototype flew for the first time in 1947 and 16 production Z 26s were built before it was replaced from 1953 by the metal construction Z 126. Development over a three decade production run resulted in numerous further improved variants. In 1952 Zlin introduced the Z 226 Trener6 which featured a more powerful 120kW (160hp) six cylinder Walter Minor 6III engine. The Z 226 was also built in single seat Z 226A Akrobat, glider tug Z 226B and Z 226T trainer forms. The similar Z 326 TrenerMaster and single seat Z 326A Akrobat introduced retractable undercarriage, a feature that became standard on all subsequent models. Deliveries began in 1959. The Z 526 differed in that the pilot flew the aircraft from the rear, rather than the front seat, with optional tip tanks and a constant speed prop. The Z 526F introduced in 1968 had a 135kW (180hp) Avia M 137A engine, the otherwise similar Z 526L differed in being powered by a 150kW (200hp) Lycoming AIO360 flat four and was intended for export. Single seat Z 526s were the Z 526A, Z 526AS, and Z 526AFS. The Z 526 AFM was built between 1981 and 1984 and was powered by a 155kW (210hp) Avia M337 engine, had tip tanks and the Z 526AFS's lengthened fuselage. Final development was the Z 726 series, the Z 726 Universal had reduced span wing, the Z 726K a 155kW (210hp) Avia M 337 engine.",
