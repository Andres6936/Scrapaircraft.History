  "history": "The successful 188 Agwagon agricultural aircraft were Cessna's only purpose designed agplanes. Cessna's Model 188 resulted from extensive research and consultation with agricultural aircraft operators conducted in the early 1960s. The design Cessna settled upon was of the conventional agricultural aircraft arrangement with a braced low wing (unique among Cessna singles) with seating for the pilot only. Like other ag aircraft the chemical hopper is of fibreglass and the rear fuselage is of semi monocoque construction and sealed to reduce the potential for damage from chemical contamination. The prototype Cessna 188 Agwagon flew for the first time on February 19 1965, and type approval was awarded the following February. The 188 was initially offered in two forms, the 170kW (230hp) Continental O-470-R powered 188 (which was named the AgPickup from 1972) and the 250kW (300hp) Continental IO-520-D powered 188A Agwagon. The 1972 model year also saw the introduction of the most successful 188 model, the AgTruck. The AgTruck has the same powerplant as the Agwagon, but a larger hopper and a higher max takeoff weight. The ultimate 188 model is the AgHusky, which was introduced in 1979. It features a turbocharged TSIO-520-T and a further increased max takeoff weight. Production of the AgPickup was suspended in 1976, the Agwagon in 1981 and the AgTruck and AgHusky in 1985, when all Cessna light aircraft production ceased.",
