  "history": "The Model 212 is a twin engined development of Bell's earlier and highly successful Model 204 and 205 series. Bell announced its decision to develop the Model 212 in early May 1968 in large part in response to a Canadian Armed Forces requirement for a twin engined development of the CUH1H (Model 205) then entering military service in that country, and following successful negotiations with Pratt & Whitney Canada and the Canadian government. Development of the Model 212 was a joint venture between Bell, Pratt & Whitney Canada and the Canadian government, the latter providing financial support. The resulting helicopter (designated CUH1N in Canadian and UH1N in US military service) first flew in 1969 and was granted commercial certification in October 1970. The first Canadian CUH1Ns were handed over in May 1971. The most significant feature of the Twin TwoTwelve is the PT6T Twin-Pac engine installation. This consists of two PT6 turboshafts mounted side by side and driving a single output shaft via a combining gearbox. The most obvious benefit of the new arrangement is better performance due to the unit's increased power output. However, the Twin-Pac engine system has a major advantage in that should one engine fail, sensors in the gearbox instruct the remaining operating engine to develop full power, thus providing a true engine out capability, even at max takeoff weight. Aside from the twin engines, the 212 features only minor detail changes over the earlier Model 205 and UH1H, including a slightly reprofiled nose. The 212 is also offered with a choice of IFR or VFR avionics suites. Production was transferred to Bell's Canadian factory in August 1988.",
