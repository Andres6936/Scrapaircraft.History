  "history": "The ATR-72 is a stretched development of the popular ATR-42 and was launched in January 1986. The first of three ATR-72 development aircraft flew for the first time on October 27 1988, followed by the awarding of French and then US certification in late 1989. Entry into service was on October 27 1989 with Kar Air of Finland. Some other early operators are Foshing Airlines, NFD (later Eurowings), CSA, American Eagle, TAT, Air Littoral, LOT, and Olympic Aviation. Significant differences between the ATR-72 and the smaller and older ATR-42 include a 4.50m (14ft 9in) fuselage stretch and reworked wings. The ATR-72's wings are new outboard of the engine nacelles and with 30% of it made up of composite materials, comprising composite spars and skin panels and a carbon fibre wing box. Aside from the baseline ATR-72-200, two developments have been offered, the ATR-72-210, and the ATR-72-500 (previously ATR-72-210A). The ATR-72-210 is optimised for operations in hot and high conditions. It has more powerful PW-127 engines for better takeoff performance. The ATR-72-500 (renamed from ATR-72-210A on May 18, 1998) further improved hot and high model was certificated in early 1997. It features PW-127Fs driving six blade composite Hamilton Sundstrand propellers. The ATR-52C is an as yet unlaunched derivative with a redesigned tail to incorporate a rear loading ramp, intended for military and commercial operators. As with the ATR-42, a military maritime patrol version, known as the Petrel 72, has also been offered. The ATR-72 would have formed the basis for the ATR-82, a 78 seat stretched development. The ATR-82 would have been powered by two Allison AE-2100 turboprops (ATR studied turbofans for a time) and would have a cruising speed as high as 610km/h (330kt). The ATR-82 was suspended when AI(R) was formed in early 1996.",
