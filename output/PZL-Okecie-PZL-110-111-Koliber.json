  "history": "The Koliber (Hummingbird) is a licence built development of the Socata Rallye. The Rallye was still in production when PZL-Okecie acquired a licence to build and develop the Rallye 100ST in Poland. The prototype Koliber was powered by a 87kW (116hp) PZLF (Franklin) four cylinder engine (Poland had earlier purchased the design and production rights to Franklin engines) and flew on April 18 1978. Initial production Kolibers featured the 86kW (116hp) engine, later aircraft a more powerful 95kW (125hp) Franklin engine. Franklin powered versions of the Koliber were the Series I, the initial production model, with 10 built and first flight occurring in May 1979; the Series II developed for Polish aero clubs which was capable of limited aerobatics (25 built); and the improved Series III (45 built). Franklin powered Koliber production ceased in 1988. The Textron Lycoming O-320 powered Koliber 150 first flew in September 1988. The 150A (Koliber II in the USA) was developed for export and was granted US FAR Part 23 certification in early 1994. According to the type's US and Asia Pacific distributor Cadmus, this was the first time that a four place fixed undercarriage light aircraft had been fully certificated in the USA in over a decade. The first Koliber 150A delivery was made to a US customer in mid 1994, while Koliber 150s have been delivered to a number of European countries. The PZL-111 Koliber 235 Senior is a more powerful, higher performance development, powered by a 175kW (235hp) Textron Lycoming O-540. It first flew in September 1995. The latest model is the 120kW (160hp) O-320-D2A powered Koliber 160A.",
