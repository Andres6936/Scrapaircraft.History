  "history": "The DA-40 Diamond Star is a composite construction four place light single now offered in avgas and jet fuel burning forms. Diamond Aircraft was formed in 1981 as Hoffmann Flugzeugbau, and following bankruptcy reformed as Hoffmann Aircraft in 1984. The company was renamed HOAC Austria Flugzeugwerk in 1990 and Diamond Aircraft in 1996. The DA-40 is its first FAR/JAR Pt23 certificated aircraft, its earlier products include the H-36 Dimona, HK-36 Super Dimona (Katana Xtreme) and the Rotax 912 and Continental IO-240 powered DV-20/DA-20 Katana two seater. The DA-20 is built in Canada. Diamond formally launched the DA-40 on April 23 1997 at the Aero 97 airshow in Friedrichshafen, Germany. The Rotax 914 powered proof of concept DA-40V-1 first flew on November 5 1997, the second prototype DA-40V-2 with a IO-240 followed shortly after. The third prototype, with a Textron Lycoming IO-360, the production powerplant, flew in 1998. Four further prototypes followed, with JAA JAR 23 certification awarded on October 25 2000. FAA and JAR certification was awarded in April 2001. The DA-40-180 is based loosely on the DA-20 but features a larger fuselage with seating for four and a slightly longer span wing. The airframe is made from glassfibre reinforced plastics with carbonfibre reinforcement in some areas. Power is from a Lycoming IO-360 with Lasar electronic fuel injection. Standard fuel capacity is 155 litres, optional fuel capacity is 200 litres. The turbo diesel Thielert Centurion 1.7 powered DA-40D TDI flew on November 28 2001. Despite \"only\" producing 100kW (135hp) the Centurion 1.7 gives the DA-40D TDI cruise performance comparable to the DA-40-180 and even better range, while burning just 17 litres of fuel (either jet fuel or diesel) an hour. Deliveries of this version started in early 2003.",
