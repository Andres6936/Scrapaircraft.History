  "history": "The Technoavia Finist is a STOL piston powered utility transport similar in concept to the venerable DHC2 Beaver, and is one of the first Russian aircraft designed from the ground up to meet western (both FAA and JAA) certification requirements. <p>The Finist (named after a small Russian bird) is the first product of the Technoavia Design Bureau. Technoavia was established in 1991 by Slava Kondratiev, a renowned Russian designer responsible for the world beating Sukhoi Su26, Su29 and Su31 series of aerobatic aircraft. Kondratiev provided finance for the new company by purchasing the rights and placing into production the four seat Yak-18T light aircraft (described separately). <p>The Finist is one of a diverse range of designs from Russian studios aimed at meeting worldwide requirements for a utility transport, but unlike most of its contemporaries it has flown and is in low rate production. The big yet elegant high wing aircraft features perhaps the best radial engine currently in production, the M14P, which also powers the Sukhoi aerobatic aircraft. The design features a high aspect ratio (10.5) wing with Fowler flaps and Frise ailerons, a large main cabin door on the left side and faired steel main landing gear units. Skis and floats will be offered as options. <p>The prototype Finist first flew on December 28 1993, while production deliveries began in January 1995. Technoavia is studying further developments of the basic aircraft, primarily a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turbine powered model. <p>The SM-92P is an armed version ordered by the Russian border guards. Up to 300 may be required. <p>Like the much older and out of production Beaver, the Finist is aimed at performing a wide variety of STOL utility missions, and with western certification behind it, it may become a realistic prospect for replacing the world's ageing fleet of utility GA aircraft. <p>",
