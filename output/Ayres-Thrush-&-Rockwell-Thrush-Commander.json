  "history": "The original Snow S2 was designed by Leland Snow, who incorporated his knowledge as an experienced ag pilot into the S2's design. The Snow S2 prototype flew for the first time in 1956 and production deliveries began in 1958. S2 variants differed in engine options, and included the 165kW (220hp) Continental W670 powered S2A, the S2B and S2C with a Pratt & Whitney R985, and the R1340AN1 powered S2C600. Aero Commander acquired the design and production rights to the S2 series in 1965 and built the improved S2D Ag Commander. The rights to the S2 changed hands once more in 1967 when North American Rockwell (later Rockwell) acquired Aero Commander, continuing the series under the Thrush Commander banner. Rockwell models include the Thrush Commander600 with a 450kW (600hp) R1340 and the Thrush Commander800 with a 595kW (800hp) Wright R1300 Cyclone. Design and production rights changed hands a final time in 1977 when Ayres (who had previously carried out turboprop conversions to Thrush Commanders) acquired the rights to the Thrush Commander600. Ayres developments include the S2R600, which later became the S2R1340; the Bull Thrush, now just S2R1820; the Polish PZL3 powered Pezetel Thrush and the turboprop powered S2R series. The S2RT11, T15 and T34 are powered by PT6s, the S2RG6 and S2RG10 AlliedSignal TPE331s. Special missions developments are the S2RT65 NEDS Narcotics Eradication Delivery System for the US State Department, and the AlliedSignal powered Vigilante surveillance and close air support version. The latest development is the 660 Turbo Thrush, based on the S2R but with a larger hopper.",
