  "history": "The CL-215 was designed as a specialist firebomber, particularly suited to Canada and other heavily forested regions. The resulting amphibious aircraft is powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radials, and is capable of scooping up 5455 litres (1200Imp gal/1440US gal) of water in 12 seconds from a water source. The CL-215 first flew on October 23 1967, and first delivery was to the French civil protection agency in June 1969. Production of batches of CL-215s continued through to 1990. Originally the subsequent CL-215T was to be a simple turboprop powered development of the CL-215, and Canadair converted two aircraft in 1989 to act as development aircraft. The first of these flew on June 8 that year. Retrofit kits for CL-215s to the new standard are offered, but Canadair elected not to build new CL-215Ts, and instead developed the CL-415. The primary improvement added to the CL-415 over the CL-215T is an EFIS avionics suite, while other improvements, some of which first appeared on the CL-215T, include winglets and finlets, higher weights and an increased capacity firebombing system. Like the CL-215 its principle mission is that of a firebomber, but various special mission (including SAR and maritime patrol) and transport configurations are available. The first CL-415 flew in December 1993 and was delivered from April 1994. The new CL-415GR has higher operating weights.",
