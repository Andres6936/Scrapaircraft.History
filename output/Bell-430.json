  "history": "Bell's 430 intermediate twin helicopter is a stretched and more powerful development of the 230. Bell began preliminary design work on the 430 in 1991, even though the 230 itself had only flown for the first time in August that year. The 430 program was formally launched in February 1992. Two prototypes were modified from Bell 230s, and the first of these flew in its new configuration on October 25 1994. The second prototype featured the full 430 avionics suite, its first flight was on December 19 1994. The first 430 production aircraft was completed in 1995, while Canadian certification was awarded on February 23 1996, allowing first deliveries from mid that year. Meanwhile 230 production wound up in August 1995, making way for the 430. Compared with the 230, the 430 features several significant improvements. Perhaps the most important of these is the new four blade, bearingless, hingeless, composite main rotor. Other changes include the 46cm (1ft 6in) stretched fuselage, allowing seating for an extra two passengers, 10% more powerful Allison 250 turboshafts (with FADEC) and an optional EFIS flightdeck. As well as the optional EFIS displays the 430 features as standard a RogersonKratos Integrated Instrument Display System (IIDS), comprising two LCD displays to present engine information. The 430 is offered with skids or retractable wheeled undercarriage. Between August 17 and September 3 1996 Americans Ron Bower and John Williams broke the round the world helicopter record with a Bell 430, flying westwards from England.
