  "history": "This series of two seat trainers and four seat light aircraft was initially developed to replacement for the successful Zlin Trener. The initial Z 42 was developed during the mid 1960s and seats two side by side. It flew for the first time on October 17 1967. The improved Z 42M meanwhile introduced a constant speed propeller and the larger tail developed for the Z 43 four seater, and replaced the Z 42 in production in 1974. Development of the two seat line continued with the further improved Z 142, which flew for the first time on December 29 1979. Changes introduced included a larger cockpit canopy and faired undercarriage. The Z 142 remained in production in Z 142C form to the mid 1990s. The latest two seater of this family to be developed is the 150kW (200hp) Textron Lycoming AEIO360 flat four powered Z 242 L. Changes aside from the engine include a three blade constant speed prop and revised engine cowling profile. First flight was on February 14 1990. Development of the four seat models, the Z 43 and Z 143, has followed that of the two seaters. The Z 43 appeared a year later than the Z 42, flying for the first time on December 10 1968. The Z 42 and Z 43 share the same basic airframe, but differ in that the Z 43 features a larger and wider cabin with seating for four, and a more powerful engine. The current Z 143 L flew for the first time on April 24 1992, and is similar in structure to the Z 242, but again differs in having a larger cabin with seating for four and a more powerful Textron Lycoming O-540 engine.",
