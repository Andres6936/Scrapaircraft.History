  "history": "The Millicer M10 AirTourer is a modern development of the Victa Airtourer, a popular Australian built aerobatic two seater. <p>Millicer Aircraft Industries was set up in the mid 1990s to place the four seat Victa Aircruiser into production as the Millicer M9 Shrike. Millicer received a favourable response to its plans to reintroduce the Aircruiser to production but at the same time realised that there existed even greater demand for the two seat Airtourer. In December 1997, following protracted negotiations, Millicer acquired the design rights to the Airtourer from the Airtourer Cooperative (who had earlier purchased the design from New Zealand Aerospace Industries) and since then has focused its primary efforts on improving the basic aircraft and returning it to production. Work on the AirCruiser (the Shrike name was dropped) continues at a slower pace. <p>Millicer is developing two basic AirTourer models, the basic M10-140 and the higher performance M10-160. The M10-140 is powered by a 105kW (140hp) Textron Lycoming O-320 (derated from 110kW/150hp, reducing noise), driving a two blade fixed pitch propeller, while the M10-160 features a 120kW (160hp) fuel injected IO-320 driving a constant speed propeller. <p>The new AirTourers feature substantial changes over their predecessors. These include a wet wing (in place of old bag type tank in the centresection), electric flaps, revised undercarriage, strengthened structure, modified wing tips, a new panel, new electrical system and others. <p>A prototype of the M10-160 (a rebuilt Airtourer rather than an all new aircraft) was the first of the new AirTourers to fly, which took place in September 1997, by which stage work on the first M10-140 was well advanced with first flight expected in February '99. <p>Production AirTourers and AirCruisers will be built in a new purpose designed factory at West Sale Airport in Victoria. Millicer plans to build seven new build AirTourers in 1999 with production ramping up in 2000. <p>",
