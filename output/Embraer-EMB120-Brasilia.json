  "history": "The Brasilia has proved to be a popular, relatively high speed yet comparatively inexpensive to operate and purchase regional airliner. Embraer first began design work on a new regional turboprop airliner in the late 1970s when the company studied stretching its EMB121 Xingu corporate turboprop to a 25 seat regional airliner. While this was the first aircraft to bear the EMB120 designation (it was named the Araguia), the production EMB120 is an all new aircraft. Design studies of the definitive EMB120 began in September 1979, first flight of a PW115 powered prototype took place on July 27 1983, and entry into service was in October 1985. Versions of the EMB120 include: the initial production EMB120; the Reduced Takeoff weight EMB120RT; the Extended Range EMB120ER; the EMB120 Cargo freighter; mixed passenger/freight EMB120 Combi; and EMB120 Convertible. Hot and high versions of these models have PW118A engines, which retain their power ratings to a higher altitude. The current production model is the EMB120ER Advanced, which incorporates a range of external and interior improvements. The fuselage of the EMB120 also forms the basis for the ERJ145 50 seat regional jet.",
