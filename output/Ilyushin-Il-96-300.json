  "history": "Despite resembling the larger Il-86, the Il-96-300 is essentially a new design, incorporating a number of advanced technologies and new engines aimed at improving on the uncompetitive Il-86. Development of Russia's second widebody airliner began in the mid 1980s, resulting in the Il-96's first flight on September 28 1988. Two other flying prototypes were built, as were two airframes to be used for static and ground testing. Commonality in some areas with the Il-86 allowed a 1200 flight hour certification program, resulting in Russian certification being awarded on December 29 1992. The Il-96-300 entered service with Aeroflot Russian International Airlines the following year. The Il-96-300 is based on the older and larger Il-86, but it features a number of new technologies previously the exclusive domain of modern western built airliners. These include a triplex flybywire flight control system, a six screen EFIS flightdeck (however three flightcrew are retained, and not two as on most modern western designs), some composite construction (including the flaps and main deck floors), and winglets. The modern PS-90 turbofans are designed to comply with ICAO Stage 3 noise limits (something the Il-86 cannot conform to) and the Il-86's unique lower deck airstair design was deleted. Perhaps the Il-96-300's greatest claim to fame though is that it forms the basis for the stretched and westernised (with Pratt & Whitney PW-2337s and Collins digital avionics) Il-96M and Il-96T, described separately.",
