  "history": "During its production life the Cessna 210 was at the top of the Cessna single piston engine model lineup, positioned between the 182 and the 310 twin. First flight of the 210 occurred in January 1957. This new aircraft featured for the first time on a Cessna aircraft retractable undercarriage and swept back vertical tail surfaces. The 210 entered production in late 1959, and from that time the line was constantly updated. Notable early upgrades include the 210B which introduced the wraparound rear windows, the 210D with a more powerful (210kW/285hp) engine and introduced the Centurion name, and the turbocharged T210F. The 210G introduced a new strutless cantilever wing, increased fuel capacity, restyled rear windows and enlarged tail surfaces. Continual development of the 210 and T210 range continued through until production ceased in 1985. A significant development of the T210 was the high performance, pressurised P210 which first appeared in 1978. The pressurisation system meant that the cabin's internal altitude was equivalent to 8000ft when flying at 17,350ft. In 1998 Cessna was considering returning the 210 to production.",
