  "history": "The Helio Courier has proven to be a highly versatile utility aircraft, renowned for its superb STOL abilities. <p>The Courier lineage traces back to a much modified experimental development of the two seat Piper Vagabond known as the KoppenBolinger Helioplane. This Helioplane featured numerous aerodynamic modifications to enhance low speed handling capabilities and STOL performance, and many of its features were subsequently incorporated into the all new and much larger Courier. <p>The Courier was initially known as the Helioplane Four and first appeared in 1952. In its first form it was powered by a 197kW (264hp) Lycoming GO435 and seated four. First flight occurred during 1953 and deliveries of the initial production model, the H391B, got underway in 1954. Subsequent development led to a number of derivatives, beginning with the H392 Strato Courier of 1957. Intended for high altitude photographic work, the H-392 was powered by a 255kW (340hp) supercharged GSO435. <p>The H395, featuring a 220kW (295hp) GO485 and seating for five or six, was the first major production version and it appeared in 1957. The H395A was similar but its engine could operate on 80 octane fuel, making it suitable for operations in remote areas. Next came the H250 (with a 185kW/250hp O540) and H295 Super Courier (220kW/295hp GO480) from 1965, and the tricycle undercarriage HT295 from 1974. The H250 remained in production until 1972, the H295 until 1976. <p>A development of the H295 with an eight cylinder 300kW (400hp) Lycoming IO720, the Courier 800, and the 260kW (350hp) TIO540 powered Courier 700 were put into production by the newly established Helio Aircraft Company from 1983, but production was limited and ceased in the late 1980s. <p>",
