  "history": "Antonov's An-140 is an all new 50 seat twin turboprop regional airliner developed to replace the ageing An-24. Antonov announced development of the An-140 in 1993. The first An-140 prototype rolled out from the Kiev factory on June 6 1997 and flew for the first time on September 17 that year. The second flying prototype was completed in late 1998, while the first production standard An-140 flew on October 11 1999. The An-140 is of conventional design and construction, with US and European certification planned in addition to Russian/CIS certification. The basic version is powered by Motor-Sich AI-30s which are licence built Klimov TV3-117VMA-SBM1s, while Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127As will be optional. The flightdeck features conventional instruments, the main cabin seats 52 in a four abreast configuration. The rear passenger door features integral stairs, while a forward starboard side freight door allows cargo to be carried. The rear of the cabin also features a galley, coat stowage and a toilet. Production of the initial basic An-140 was superseded in 2003 by the An-140-100 which features a 1.00m (3ft 3in) increase in wing span, a higher MTOW and a 300km (160nm) longer range. Other future versions include the An-140A for Aeroflot which will be powered by PW127As, the An-140T freighter which would have a large freight door on the rear port side, the convertible An-140TK, the An-140VIP executive version, and the An-142 with a rear loading freight ramp. Military versions are also planned. Series production of the An-140 is being undertaken at Kharkov by KhGAPP in Ukraine and at Samara in Russia by Aviacor. The first few aircraft were for Odessa Airlines, Aeromost (originally named Aeromist), Motor-Sich and Illich Avia. In 1996 Antonov signed an agreement with HESA in Iran for licence assembly of an An-140 model called the IRAN-140 Faraz at a new plant in Esfahan. Initial IRAN-140s will be assembled from supplied kits, with gradually increasing Iranian local content. the first Faraz flew in February 2001. Iran Asseman and Iran Air are expected to be customers.",
