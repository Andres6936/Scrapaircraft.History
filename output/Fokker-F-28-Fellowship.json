  "history": "The F28 Fellowship jet was developed to complement Fokker's highly successful F-27 Friendship turboprop. Fokker began development of the F28 in 1960 after perceiving a market for a higher performance (ie jet engined) and greater capacity airliner in comparison with the F-27. First details of the F28 were made public in April 1962, and production of the first development aircraft began in 1964. The first of three prototypes flew for the first time on May 9 1967, with certification and first customer delivery both occurring on February 24 1969. The F28 was developed into a range of models. Initial production was of the Mk 1000, which could typically seat between 55 and 65, and was powered by 43.8kN (9850lb) Spey Mk 55515 turbofans. The Mk 2000 was essentially similar but featured a 2.21m (7ft 3in) fuselage stretch, increasing maximum seating to 79. The Mks 5000 and 6000 were based on the 1000 and 2000 respectively, but introduced a longer span wing (by 1.49m/4ft 11in) and wing leading edge slats. Neither version attracted serious sales interest, and no 5000s and just two 6000s were built. Another version that did not come to fruition was the Mk 6600, which would have been stretched by a further 2.21m (7ft 3in), allowing for seating for 100 in a high density layout. It was aimed at Japanese airlines. The final production models were the 3000 and 4000, again based on the 1000 and 2000 respectively. Both introduced a number of improvements, while the addition of two extra above wing emergency exits on the 4000 increased maximum seating to 85. Freight door equipped convertible versions of each model were offered, and are identified by a C suffix.",
