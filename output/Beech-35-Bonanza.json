  "history": "The distinctive Model 35 Bonanza is one of general aviation's most famous and prolific types, and enjoyed a production life spanning four decades. The Bonanza first flew on December 22 1945. Featuring metal construction, retractable undercarriage and high performance, it heralded a new class of high performance GA aircraft. The design also featured the distinctive Vtail, incorporated for aerodynamic efficiency and reduced weight. Deliveries of production aircraft began in 1947. Subsequent development led to a significant family of subtypes. Briefly these are the A35 of 1949 with a greater max takeoff weight; the B35 with a 146kW (196hp) E1858 engine; the 153kW (205hp) E18511 powered C, D and E models through to 1954; the F and G35 with third cabin window and 170kW (225hp) E2258 of the mid fifties; the 180kW (240hp) Continental O470G powered H35 of 1957; the fuel injected 187kW (250hp) powered J35; 1960's M35 with larger rear windows; and the N35 and P35 with a 195kW (260hp) IO470N and greater max takeoff weight. Then followed the redeveloped S35 of 1964 with six seats and redesigned rear cabin, optional three blade prop, 215kW (285hp) IO520B engine and yet greater weights; the heavier V35 of 1966; and turbocharged V35TC; V35A and V35ATC of 1968 with more raked windscreen; and the V35B and V35BTC (just seven built) from 1970. The V35B remained in production until 1982 and underwent a number of detail changes in that time.",
