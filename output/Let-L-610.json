  "history": "The Let L 610 is a stretched development of the earlier L 410, and although originally designed for a Soviet requirement, in its westernised form is now marketed worldwide. The L 610 was conceived in the mid 1980s to meet a Soviet Union requirement for a new 40 seat turboprop airliner. A production run of 500 was envisaged for primary customer Aeroflot, and the L 610's design was optimised to suit that carrier's requirements (including operations from austere airfields). The basic L 610M for Aeroflot is a stretched 40 seat development of the L 410 powered by two 1358kW (1822shp) Motorlet M 602 turboprops. It first flew on December 28 1988, and a small number were delivered to Aeroflot during 1991 before Let suspended deliveries, stating that they would not resume unless western currency was used for payment. As a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism throughout eastern Europe, Let began development of a westernised version intended to significantly widen the type's sales appeal. Known as the L 610G, it is optimised for world markets and features General Electric CT7 turboprops, Collins Pro Line II digital EFIS avionics, Collins weather radar and autopilot. First flight of the L 610G prototype occurred on December 18 1992 (four years after the L 610M), and, after some delays, US FAA certification is planned for 1999. Let has high hopes that the L 610 will penetrate the very crowded, international market for 40 seat airliners and the Czech Republic's lower labour costs should see the aircraft priced competitively compared to its western competitors. No doubt, sales interest will increase once western certification is awarded, while new Let owner Ayres is keen to develop the L610 further and exploit its potential.",
