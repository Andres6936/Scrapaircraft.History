  "history": "The W3 Sokol (Falcon) utility is the first helicopter to be fully designed and built in Poland, and is PZL Swidnik's most promising sales prospect in the near to medium future. Developed during the mid 1970s, the Sokol made its first flight on November 16 1979, and has since been certificated in Poland, Russia, the US and Germany. Following a fairly protracted development program, low rate production of the Sokol commenced during 1985. Initial sales of the general purpose Sokol were within Poland and in the Eastern Bloc, before the collapse of communism allowed PZL Swidnik to broaden its sales base. To do this PZL Swidnik developed the improved W3A Sokol aimed at achieving western certification. Certification to US FAR Pt 29 standards was granted in May 1993, while German certification was granted in December that year. The Sokol is of conventional design and construction, with two PZL10W turboshafts, which are based on the Russian designed TVD10B turboprops that power the Polish built An-28. Composites are used in the tail and main rotor blades. The Sokol is offered in a number of variants and is capable of performing a typical range of helicopter missions, including passenger transport, VIP, cargo, EMS, medevac, firefighting and search and rescue (the W3 RM Anaconda). An upgraded version of the Sokol is currently under development. The SW5 (a provisional designation) would have twin FADEC equipped 745kW (1000shp) Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6B-67B turboshafts, Sextant supplied avionics, a simplified rotor head and greater use of composites.",
