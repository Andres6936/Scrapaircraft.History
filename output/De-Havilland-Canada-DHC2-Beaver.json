  "history": "De Havilland Canada's first purpose designed bush aircraft, the Beaver was that company's most successful program sales wise (both military or civil), with almost 1700 built in a production run lasting two decades. <p>Beaver development work began in 1946 and the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests had considerable input into the final design and configuration of this rugged and versatile utility. A prototype flew on August 16 1947, with seating for five or six, although the production Beaver grew slightly to seat an extra two passengers by the time civil certification was awarded in March 1948. <p>The only major development of the Beaver (aside from a one off powered by a 410kW/550hp Alvis Leonides 502/4 radial engine) was the Turbo Beaver. First flown in December 1963 it featured a Pratt & Whitney PT6A6 turboprop, which offered lower empty and higher takeoff weights, and even better STOL performance. The Turbo Beaver's cabin was also longer, allowing maximum accommodation for 11, including the pilot. Externally, the Turbo Beaver had a much longer and reprofiled nose, and squared off vertical tail. DHC also offered conversion kits enabling piston powered Beavers to be upgraded to Turbo standard. Other conversions have been performed. <p>",
