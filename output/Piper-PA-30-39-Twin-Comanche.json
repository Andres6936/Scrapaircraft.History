  "history": "As its name implies, the Twin Comanche is a twin engine development of the PA-24 Comanche. When in production, it was Piper's premier four/six place light twin, replacing the Apache 235 and positioned beneath the larger and more powerful Aztec. The Twin Comanche was originally proposed as early as 1956, when the single engine Comanche was undergoing initial development, however the project was delayed while Piper worked on the Comanche and the Aztec twin. So it was not until 1962 that a Comanche was converted to a twin configuration with two 120kW (160hp) IO-320s (originally two 110kW (150hp) engines were planned), with first flight on November 7 1962. First flight of a production Twin Comanche was in May 1963, with first deliveries later that year. The Twin Comanche differed little from its single engine brethren other than changes associated with its twin engine layout, and it quickly proved to be very popular. Improvements to the PA-30 resulted in the introduction of the Twin Comanche B in 1965, which featured a stretched fuselage allowing seating for up to six, as on the equivalent Comanche B single, while turbocharged engines and wingtip tanks were offered as options as the Turbo Twin Comanche B. From 1970 the Twin Comanche C featured a slightly higher cruising speed and interior improvements, while the PA-39 Twin Comanche C/R was fitted with counter rotating engines. Production of the Twin Comanche ceased in 1972 - by which time only the PA-39 was available - due to the flooding of Piper's Lock Haven factory.",
