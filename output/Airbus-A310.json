  "history": "The A310 first began life as the A300B10, one of a number of projected developments and derivatives of Airbus' original A300B airliner. While based on the larger A300, the A310 introduced a number of major changes. The fuselage was shortened by 13 frames compared to the A300B, reducing seating to around 200 to 230 passengers and a new higher aspect ratio wing of smaller span and area was developed. New and smaller horizontal tail surfaces, fly-by-wire outboard spoilers and a two crew EFIS flightdeck were incorporated, while the engine pylons were common to suit both engine options. The first flight of the A310 occurred on April 3 1982, after the program was launched in July 1978. Service entry was with Lufthansa in April 1983. Early production A310s did not have the small winglets that became a feature of later build A310-200s and the A310-300. The A310-300 is a longer range development of the base A310-200, and has been in production since 1985. This version can carry a further 7000kg (15,430lb) of fuel in the tailplane. The A310-200F freighter is available new build or as a conversion of existing aircraft (13 A310s were converted to freighters for Federal Express by Airbus partner Daimler Benz [now DaimlerChrysler] Aerospace Airbus). The A310-200C convertible passenger/freighter first entered service with Dutch operator Martinair in 1984.",
