  "history": "Development from the basic AB-95 (which first flew in 1959) has spawned one of the largest families of GA types yet developed in South America. Versions of the AB-95 include the AB-95 Standard, the AB-95 De Lujo with a 75kW (100hp) Continental O-200A engine, the AB-95A Fumigador ag aircraft with the O-200A engine and fitted for crop dusting or spraying, the AB-115BS air ambulance fitted with a stretcher, the more powerful AB-95B, and the AB-95-115 with a more streamlined engine cowling housing a 85kW (115hp) O-235 engine, and main wheel fairings. From the AB-95-115 Aero Boero developed the AB-115BS with increased wing span, greater fin sweepback and longer range, and the AB-115 Trainer. Brazil ordered 450 Trainers in the late 1980s for its aero clubs. The AB-180 first flew in the late 1960s and was offered in three and four seat versions with differing wingspans and a more powerful powerplant than those featured on the earlier AB-95 and AB-115. Developments included the AB-180RV with greater range, reprofiled fuselage and sweptback fin; the glider tug AB-180RVR; the high altitude AB-180 Condor with optional engine turbocharger; AB-180AG agricultural aircraft and the two seat AB-180PSA preselection aircraft for student pilot flight grading. An experimental biplane AB-180SP was also developed. The AB-150RV and AB-150AG have less powerful powerplants than corresponding AB-180 models.",
