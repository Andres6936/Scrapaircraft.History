  "history": "Mooney's new owners, the Republic Steel Company, placed the M-20 line back into production in late 1973. All three then current models, the Ranger, Chaparral and Executive, were returned to production, but new design efforts centred around the M-20F Executive design. The first model developed was the M-20J 201, with improvements aimed at reducing drag giving a theoretical top speed of 323km/h (175kt), or 201mph. The 201 entered production in 1976, replacing the Executive, while the Ranger remained in production until 1979. Subsequent models included the M-20K 231 from late 1978, powered by a turbocharged Continental TSIO-360 six cylinder engine, and the 201LM (Lean Machine) from 1986 with only basic options. The 201 evolved into the M-20J 205 with rounded cabin windows and redesigned wingtips, giving a slight increase in top speed. A Special Edition 'SE' luxury options package was also offered. The M-20K 252TSE (Turbo Special Edition) was a development of the 231 with a top speed of 405km/h (220kt), or 252mph, and combined the 205's airframe mods with a 155kW (210hp) turbocharged, intercooled Continental TSIO-360. The Porsche PFM-3200 powered M-20L was built between 1987 and 1991. The current top of the line model is the Bravo - formerly the M-20M TLS/Bravo (Turbo Lycoming Sabre) - which was introduced in 1989 and features a slightly stretched fuselage, a turbocharged and intercooled Textron Lycoming TIO-540 and three blade prop. The Allegro - formerly the M-20J MSE 205 - development is powered by a 150kW (200hp) Textron Lycoming IO-360A3B6D. Introduced in 1994, the M-20R Ovation is based on the Bravo fuselage but is powered by a 210kW (280hp) Continental IO-550G flat six. In 1997 Mooney introduce the short lived 370km/h (200kt) cruise M-20K Encore which was powered by a turbocharged TSIO360.",
