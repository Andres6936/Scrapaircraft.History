  "history": "The Cessna 172 is without doubt the most successful mass produced light aircraft in history. From 1955 through to 1967 the 172 was powered by the six cylinder Continental O-300, before this engine was replaced by the four cylinder Lycoming O-320. The Cessna 172 started life as a relatively simple tricycle undercarriage development of the taildragger 170, with a fairly basic level of standard equipment. First flight was in November 1955. The 172 became an overnight sales success and over 1400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production. The basic 172 remained in production until replaced by the 172A of early 1960. The 172A introduced a swept back tail and rudder, while the 172B of late 1960 introduced a shorter undercarriage, equipment changes and for the first time the Skyhawk name for the Deluxe option. The 172D of 1963 introduced the cut down rear fuselage with wraparound rear window. The 172F introduced electric flaps and was built in France by Reims Cessna as the F172 through to 1971. It also formed the basis for the US Air Force's T-41A Mescalero primary trainer. The 172G of 1966 introduced a more pointed spinner, while the 172H was the last Continental powered 172. The 175 (Skylark for the Deluxe option) meanwhile was powered by a 130kW (175hp) geared GO-300, the GO-300 powered P172D Powermatic of 1963 had a constant speed prop. The 1966 R172E had a Continental IO-360 and a constant speed prop. It was built in France as the FR172 Reims Rocket.",
