  "history": "The Caravelle was the first jet airliner to enter production in continental Europe and pioneered the rear mounted engine layout. The Caravelle was designed in response to a French Secretariat General of Commercial and Civil Aviation requirement for a 1600 to 2000km (865 to 1080nm) range airliner (allowing operations between France and its North African dependents) with a 6000 to 7000kg (13,228 to 15,432lb) payload requirement at a speed of 620km/h (335kt). SNCASE (Societe Nationale de Constructions Aeronautiques de Sud-Est, later Sud Aviation, and subsequently merged into Aerospatiale), responded with a trijet design designated the X120, with three rear mounted SNECMA Atar turbojets. This design then matured to feature two rear mounted Rolls-Royce Avons. The French government ordered two flying and two static prototypes of the twinjet in 1953, resulting in the type's first flight on May 27 1955. Entry into service of the SE-210 Caravelle I with Air France was on May 12 1959 on the Paris/Rome/Istanbul route. The Caravelle III featured 50.7kN (11,400lb) Avon RA.29 Mk527s (one Caravelle III was powered by General Electric CJ805-23C turbofans, but production never eventuated). The 54.3kN (12,200lb) Avon RA.29 Mk531 powered VI-N and the VI-R with a modified windscreen and thrust reversers followed. The Caravelle 10B introduced more fuel efficient Pratt & Whitney JT8D turbofans, while the 11R was a convertible passenger/freighter based on the 10. The ultimate Caravelle model was the 3.20m (10ft 6in) stretched Caravelle. It could seat up to 128 single class passengers.",
