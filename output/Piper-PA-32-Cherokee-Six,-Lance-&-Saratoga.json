  "history": "The PA-32 series began life as the Cherokee Six, a significantly modified six seat development of the PA-28 Cherokee series. While similar in configuration to the Cherokee, the Cherokee Six differed in a number of major areas. Two of the big differences were implied in its name, a six cylinder O-540 or IO-540 powerplant, and the six seat configuration. While the wing was based on the Cherokee's, the fuselage was substantially larger, with strengthened undercarriage and a larger tail. The Cherokee Six first flew on December 6 1963, while deliveries of production PA-32-260s began from mid 1965. Development led to a range of improved models, starting with the 225kW (300hp) fuel injected IO-540 powered Cherokee Six 300 (PA-32-300). Production of the 260 and 300 ended in the late 1970s, but in the meantime they had been joined by the PA-32R Cherokee Lance. The Cherokee Lance, or just Lance from mid 1977 with the introduction of the improved Lance II, was a retractable undercarriage development. The Lance II and turbocharged PA-32R-300T Turbo Lance also introduced a T-tail as the PA-32RT and remained in production to late 1979. The Lance II and Cherokee Six were replaced by the Saratoga. Available in fixed or retractable undercarriage form, with standard or turbocharged powerplants, the major change was the new increased span tapered wing. Production of the Saratoga ceased in 1985, but New Piper reintroduced the Saratoga II HP in 1993 with aerodynamic improvements and a revised instrument panel and interior. The turbocharged Saratoga II TC was introduced in 1997. 1999 models introduce new Garmin and S-TEC avionics. A five seat interior with a entertainment/workstation console (similar to that in the Seneca V) is optional. The PA-32 was also built under licence in Brazil as the Embraer EMB-720 Minuano, and the PA-32R as the EMB-721 Sertanejo, while Chincul in Argentina built the PA-32 as PA-A-32, the PA-32R as PA-A-32R, and the PA-32RT as the PA-A-32RT. Production of the Saratoga ceased in 1985, but Piper reintroduced the Saratoga II HP in 1993 with aerodynamic improvements and a revised instrument panel and interior. The turbocharged Saratoga II TC was introduced in 1997. The 1999 models introduced new Garmin and S-TEC avionics.
