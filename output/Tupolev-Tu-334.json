  "history": "The advanced technology Tu-334 100 seat jet was developed as a replacement for the aging Tu-134. Development of a replacement for the Tu-134 began in the late 1980s, but it was not until August 1995 at the Moscow Airshow that the first prototype was displayed publicly. The aircraft made its first flight on December 8, 1999. The Tu-334 was based on the much larger Tu-204 twinjet with Tupolev using as many Tu-204 features in the new design as practical to reduce development time and costs. Examples of this include an identical flightdeck and a shortened Tu-204 fuselage. In addition the Tu-334's wing is based on the Tu-204's, although the latter's is a significantly larger unit. Apart from commonality with the Tu-204, other notable Tu-334 design features were the rear fuselage mounted Progress D-436 turbofans, T-tail and fly-by-wire flight controls. It was planned that the Tu-334 would be developed in a number of versions. The first was the basic Tu-334-100, while the Tu-334-120 was planned to be powered by the BMW Rolls-Royce BR710-48. The Tu-354 (previously Tu-334-200) would have been a stretched, 35m (115ft) long 110 to 126 seater (in a single class). Apart from the fuselage stretch, planned changes included more powerful D436T2 or BR715-55 turbofans, an increased span wing and four wheel main undercarriage units. The Tu-334-100D would have been a longer range Tu-334-100 featuring the 100's standard length fuselage but with more powerful engines, increased fuel capacity, a higher max takeoff weight and the increased span wings of the Tu-334-200. Tupolev also studied the Tu-334C, which would have been a freighter. Development of the Tu-334 remained slow due to protracted budget problems and there were numerous delays. Eventually, in 2009, after the rationalization of the Russian aviation industry, the TU-334 program was cancelled in favor of the Antonov An-148 and the Sukhoi Superjet 100.",
