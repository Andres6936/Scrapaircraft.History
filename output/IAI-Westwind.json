  "history": "The IAI Westwind has become one of the success stories of the small but effective Israeli aviation industry. The Westwind started life as the Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander or Commodore Jet, a General Electric CJ610 turbojet powered small executive jet based on Aero Commander's successful piston and turboprop twin line. The first 1121 flew on January 2 1963, with deliveries of production aircraft from early 1965. However North American Rockwell shortly afterwards acquired Aero Commander, and as it was already building the Sabreliner (described under Rockwell), the Jet Commander line had to be sold off because of antitrust laws. Thus the design and production rights for the Jet Commander were sold to Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) in 1968. IAI completed production of the 1121 Commodore Jets (total US/Israeli production was 150) before developing the 1123 Westwind with a stretched fuselage allowing seating for 10 passengers. The Westwind first flew in September 1970. Thirty-six turbojet powered 1123s were built before production transferred to the Garrett TFE731 turbofan powered 1124 (known as the Westwind I from 1981), the first of which were delivered in mid 1976. The 1124N Sea Scan was announced in 1976 and is a radar equipped maritime patrol and surveillance derivative. Development of the basic 1124 led to the 1124A Westwind 2 with improved hot and high performance, better fuel economy and longer range. Delivered from May 1980, changes over the 1124 included a modified wing section, winglets, flat cabin floor and other interior improvements. Production ceased in 1987 in favour of the 1125 Astra (described separately under Galaxy Aerospace).",
