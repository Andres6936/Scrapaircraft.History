  "history": "The Challenger 601 addressed the original CL-600 Challenger's weight problems and replaced the troubled ALF-502 turbofans, creating a highly successful full size corporate jet. Troubles with the Avco Lycoming powered Challenger 600 led Canadair (now a division of Bombardier) to develop a vastly improved variant in the form of the General Electric CF-34 powered Challenger 601. Another important change was the addition of winglets, which are also offered as a retrofit to earlier aircraft. The 601 first flew on April 10 1982 and for a time was offered alongside the 600. The 600 was dropped from the model line in 1983. Subsequent development of the Challenger led to the 601-3A. First flying in 1987, this variant introduced an EFIS glass flightdeck and upgraded engines. Available from 1989, the 601-3R was an extended range model with higher weights (the range increase modifications can also be retrofitted to earlier 601-3As). Further improvements to the basic design led to the Challenger 604. Improvements include an advanced Collins ProLine IV EFIS avionics system with colour displays, higher weights, CF-34-3B turbofans and increased fuel tankage. Many other minor changes were incorporated based on Bombardier's experience with the Canadair Regional Jet. First flight with CF-34-3A engines was in September 1994, first flight with the CF-34-3B engines was on March 17 1995, with Transport Canada certification granted that September. First delivery was in January 1996.",
