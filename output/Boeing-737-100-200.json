  "history": "The 737-100 and 200 are the first generation production models of the world's most successful jet airliner family, Boeing's 737 twinjet. The 737 was conceived as a short range small capacity airliner to round out the Boeing jet airliner family beneath the 727, 720 and 707. Announced in February 1965, the 737 was originally envisioned as a 60 to 85 seater, although following consultation with launch customer Lufthansa, a 100 seat design was settled upon. Design features included two underwing mounted turbofans and 60% structural and systems commonality with the 727, including the same fuselage cross section (making it wider than the competing five abreast DC-9 and BAC-111). The 737-100 made its first flight on April 9 1967 and entered service in February 1968 with Lufthansa, while the last of 30 built was delivered to Malaysia-Singapore Airlines in October 1969. By this time however the larger capacity 1.93m (6ft 4in) stretched 737-200 was in service after it had made its first flight on August 8 1967. First delivery, to United, was that December. Developments of the -200 include the -200C convertible and quick change -200QC, while an unprepared airfield kit was also offered. The definitive Advanced 737-200 appeared in 1971, featuring minor aerodynamic refinements and other improvements. Sales of the 737-200 far exceeded that of the shorter -100 and the 737-200 remained in production until 1988, by which time it had been superseded by the improved 737-300, after 1114 had been built. Many have been fitted with Stage 3 engine hushkits, and a number of passenger aircraft have been converted with cargo doors. The USAF ordered 19 as navigation trainers, and some were later converted to standard transport aircraft as CT-43A. A few other air forces received 737-200s to serve in general transport, surveillance or VIP transport tasks.",
