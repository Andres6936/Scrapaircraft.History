  "history": "First conceived in the late 1950s as a lower cost derivative of the Vtail Bonanza, the conventional tail Debonair and Bonanza family remains in production today. Compared with the equivalent Model 35, the first model 33 Debonair introduced a conventional three surface tail, a less powerful engine and a more austere interior fit. It first flew on September 14 1959 and was included in Beech's model range the following year. The subsequent A33 and B33 Debonairs offered a small number of changes, while the C33 introduced a third cabin window and restyled interior. The Debonair was dropped from the range in 1967, by which time the C33A had been released, an aircraft very similar in performance and trim level to the Vtail Bonanzas, and the name Bonanza was adopted for this model range as well. Development of the 33 continued with the E33 and 155kW (285hp) E33A, the aerobatic E33C, the economy G33 and the F33, available in 155kW (285hp) A and aerobatic C models. The F33A remained in production until 1996. The larger six seat Model 36 was first released in 1968, featuring a stretched cabin, 155kW (285hp) engine and greater takeoff weights. This aircraft remains in production today as the A36 (with an annual production rate of around 80 units). The turbocharged 225kW (300hp) A36TC first appeared in 1979, production switched to the current B36TC in 1981.",
