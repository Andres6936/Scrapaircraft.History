  "history": "With a maximum takeoff weight of over 100 tonnes (220,500lb), Short's Belfast is one of the largest turboprop powered aircraft built, behind the massive 250 tonne (551,250lb) max takeoff An-22 (described separately) and Douglas' C133 Cargomaster of the 1950s. The Belfast was developed in response to a Royal Air Force requirement for a heavy lift freighter capable of carrying a wide range of military hardware, including artillery pieces, 200 plus troops, helicopters and/or guided missiles over relatively long ranges. Short had studied a number of large freighter designs during the late 1950s, and what became the Belfast began life as the SC.5/10, design work on which began in February 1959. Development of the SC.5/10 design resulted in a first flight of the Belfast on January 5 1964. Design features of this big aircraft included four RollsRoyce Tyne turboprops mounted on a high wing, an 18 wheel undercarriage (comprising two eight wheel main bogeys and two wheel nose undercarriage system) and beaver tail rear loading doors and ramp. When the Belfast entered service with the RAF in January 1966 it was the largest aircraft to be operated by that service. The Belfast's military career was relatively short lived, and all 10 were retired in 1976. Heavylift (then TAC Heavylift) acquired five Belfasts for commercial service in 1977, and three were placed into service in 1980. Marshall of Cambridge performed a number of modifications on the Belfast which allowed it to be certificated to civil standards on March 6 1980. Since then Heavylift's Belfasts have given the company a useful heavylift capability to carry heavy and awkward sized loads, bettered only by its An-124s. One remained in use in 1998.",

  "production": "Only 10 Belfasts built specifically for the UK's Royal Air Force. One remains in commercial service with Heavylift in 1998 (none are in military service)."
