  "history": "The King Air 300 is an updated version of the successful B200 series, and it itself was replaced by the further improved King Air 350, the latest model in this long running and successful line of corporate and utility transports. <p>Design of an improved development of the successful King Air B200 began in August 1981, the 14 month design effort culminating in the first flight of the modernised 300 model in October the following year. Improvements to the B200 were many, with the main change being the installation of more powerful PT6A60A turboprops in place of the 42s of the earlier model. Other changes included reprofiled and more aerodynamically clean engine cowls and exhausts and extended wing leading edges, plus minor internal changes. Both empty and max takeoff weights were also increased. <p>The max weight was reduced for the 300LW or `Light Weight', intended to minimise the effects of weight based airways user fees, particularly in Europe. The 300AT was an airline pilot trainer. <p>The King Air 300 has been replaced by the 350, its major improvements being a stretched fuselage lengthened by 86cm (2ft 10in) and the addition of winglets. The latest member of the King Air family, it had its first flight in 1988, and has been in production since late 1989. The King Air 350C features a builtin airstair and a 132 x 132cm (52 x 52in) freight door. The 350 is also available in a range of special missions and military variants. <p>The `Super' prefix was dropped from the King Air name in 1996. <p>",
