  "history": "The Pacer and Tri-Pacer designs were Piper's volume selling four seaters from 1949 through to the introduction of the Comanche and Cherokee in the early 1960s, while the Colt was a two seat training derivative of the Tri-Pacer. The original tail dragger PA-20 Pacer was introduced in 1949 alongside the two seat PA-18 Super Cub, and the prototype was powered by a 85kW (115hp) Lycoming O-235-C1 engine. The production aircraft had a 93kW (125hp) Lycoming O-290-D engine, and were available with a wooden fixed pitch propeller as the '125', and with a metal controllable pitch propeller as the '135'. In 1950 the PA-20 was also available with the 85kW (115hp) Lycoming O-235-C1 engine as the PA-20-115. The aircraft could be equipped with floats as the PA-20S. From 1952 the Pacer was powered by a 100kW (135hp) O-290-D2 engine as the PA-20-135. Production ended in 1954. The tricycle undercarriage PA-22 Tri-Pacer initially augmented from 1950 the Pacer in production, powered by a 93kW (125hp) Lycoming O-290-D for 1951 and 1952, available with the same propeller options as the PA-20. From 1952 to 1954 the Tri-Pacer was powered by a 100kW (135hp) O-290-D2 engine, and in 1955 gained a 110kW (150hp) O-320-A2B engine and a higher takeoff weight, and a 120kW (160hp) O-320-B from 1958. For 1959 and 1960 Piper offered a lower spec less expensive version of the Tri-Pacer in the form of the PA-22-150 Caribbean. The two seat PA-22-108 Colt was derived from the Tri-Pacer but had a less powerful 85kW (108hp) engine, lower maximum takeoff weight, no rear cabin windows, the removal of a rear door and less fuel capacity, but otherwise the two airframes were identical. Piper introduced the Colt to its lineup in late 1960, and the type remained in production for just over two years until the two seat Cherokee could be introduced. Colt production ceased in 1964 after almost 2000 had been built. A number of PA-22s have been converted to PA-20 tailwheel configuration, for which a conversion kit was offered by Univair. The Tri-Pacer and Colt were Piper's only high wing tricycle undercarriage aircraft, and the last in production to feature metal tubing and fabric covering construction.",
