  "history": "The DC-9-40 and DC-9-50 are stretched developments of the DC-9-30 and predecessors to the later further lengthened MD-80 and MD-90 series. The DC-9-40 was developed in response to a Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) requirement for a larger capacity development of the DC-9. Compared with the DC-9-30, the DC-9-40 is 1.88m (6ft 2in) longer, raising seating capacity in a single class configuration to 125. Apart from the fuselage stretch and more powerful engine options, the -40 was the much the same as the -30. First flight occurred on November 28 1967, and the -40 entered service with SAS on March 12 the following year. The DC-9-50 is the largest member of the DC-9/MD-80/MD-90/717 family to bear the DC-9 designation. Launched in mid 1973, the DC-9-50 is a further 2.44m (8ft 0in) longer than the DC-9-40, or 4.34m (14ft 3in) longer than the DC-9-30, and has maximum seating for 139 passengers. Delivered from August 1975, the DC-9-50 introduced a new look cabin interior designed to make more efficient use of the space available and give the impression of a more spacious interior, plus other improved features such as an improved anti skid braking system and quieter engines compared with the DC-9-40. The DC-9-40 and -50 sold only in fairly modest numbers before the arrival of the further stretched MD-80 series. The largest DC-9-40 customer was SAS, while Northwest continues to operate a large fleet of DC-9-40s and -50s (it is currently the largest DC-9 operator in the world).",
