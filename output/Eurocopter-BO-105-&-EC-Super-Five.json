  "history": "In widespread military and civilian service, the BO 105 is MBB's (now part of Eurocopter) most successful helicopter design. <p>Construction of the first of three prototypes began in 1964, the first of which made the type's first flight on February 16 1967. This aircraft was powered by 236kW (317shp) Allison 250C18 turboshafts and featured a conventional main rotor hub, but the subsequent prototypes incorporated a new rigid hub with feathering hinges, plus composite blades and MANTurbo 6022 engines. The BO 105 reverted back to Allison 250 power with the second of two preproduction aircraft, flying in this form in January 1971. <p>Initial production was of the BO 105C which was available from 1970. The Allison 250C20 powerplant became standard from 1973. The BO 105 CB was introduced in 1975, and became the standard production model. It introduced uprated engines and a strengthened transmission. The BO 105 is now built in BO 105 CBS form with a slight 25cm (10in) fuselage stretch and extra window, allowing an extra passenger to be carried. <p>The BO 105 D has IFR instrumentation and was developed for the British offshore oil rig support market. The BO 105 L has more powerful engines and higher takeoff weight. The BO 105 LSA-3 is a hot and high version with Allison 250C28C engines and built exclusively in Canada by Eurocopter Canada. The BO 105 LSA-3 Super Lifter has been developed for aerial crane work and has a 2850kg (6283lb) max takeoff weight. <p>The EC Super Five is a high performance development of the BO 105 CBS with new main rotor blades. It was certificated in late 1993. <p>",
