  "history": "In July 1975 Cessna announced it was developing a new piston twin suitable for airline, freight and corporate work, capable of taking off with a 1560kg (3500lb) payload from a 770m (2530ft) strip, similar in concept to the successful 402, but larger overall. The resulting aircraft was the Model 404 Titan, Cessna's largest piston engined twin developed thus far. It shares the same basic fuselage as the turbine powered 441 Conquest which was developed concurrently, but differs in having geared 280kW (375hp) piston engines and it is unpressurised. Other features include a bonded wet wing (then appearing on a number of 400 series Cessna twins) and the trailing link main undercarriage design shared with the Conquest. The prototype Titan first flew on February 26 1975, production deliveries got underway in October the following year. Throughout the Titan's model life it was offered in three major versions, each differing in internal equipment fit. The base aircraft was the Titan Ambassador, configured for passenger operations, while the Titan Courier was convertible from passenger to freight configurations, and the Titan Freighter was a pure cargo aircraft. The Titan Freighter was specially equipped for freight operations with a strengthened floor, cargo doors and walls and a ceiling made from impact resistant material. All were offered with II and III avionics equipment levels (as with other Cessna twins). The Titan underwent minor modifications from 1980 when the wing span was increased and the wingtips redesigned, but production was to last for only another two years until 1982, by which time 378 had been built.",
