  "history": "The Global Express is one of a new class of ultra long range corporate jets, and competes against the Gulfstream V, Boeing 737 BBJ and Airbus A319CJ (all described separately). Designed to fly long distances at high speed, the Global Express' range is such that it can fly between any two points on the globe and need only one refuelling stop, while it can fly nonstop between intercontinental destinations such as Sydney/Los Angeles, New York/Tokyo and Taipei/Chicago. Bombardier's Canadair division announced development of the Global Express in October 1991 at the annual NBAA conference in the USA. Officially launched on December 20 1993, it flew for the first time on October 13 1996, with Canadian certification awarded on July 31 1998 and US certification following in November that year. First customer deliveries are planned for first quarter of 1999. The Global Express shares the Canadair Regional Jet's fuselage cross section and is similar in length, but despite the size similarities the two aircraft are very different due to the nature of their roles. The Global Express features an advanced all new supercritical wing with a 35\u00b0 sweep and winglets, plus a new Ttail. The engines are BMW RollsRoyce BR-710s with FADEC. The advanced flightdeck features a six screen Honeywell Primus 2000 XP EFIS suite and is offered with optional heads-up displays. Three Bombardier divisions are involved with the Global Express - Canadair is the Global Express' design leader and manufactures the nose; Shorts is responsible for the design and manufacture of the engine nacelles, horizontal stabiliser and forward fuselage; and de Havilland at Downsview is responsible for final assembly and builds the rear fuselage and vertical tail. In addition, Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries builds the wing and centre fuselage sections in Nagoya.",
