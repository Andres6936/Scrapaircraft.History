  "history": "The Let L-200 Morava retractable four seat light twin was one of the few light aircraft to be exported from behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War era, albeit in small numbers. Ladislav Smrek of the Czechoslovakian State Aircraft Factory designed the L-200 in the mid 1950s to develop a replacement for the early postwar vintage Aero 45 and 145 light twins. His resulting design is similar in many ways to its contemporary western twins, with a four or five place cabin, a low wing, wingtip tanks, metal construction and retractable undercarriage. However the Morava is distinguishable by its twin tails, standard thermal wing deicing equipment and inverted inline engines. The prototype XL-200 Morava flew for the first time on April 8 1957. The XL-200 prototype and a series of preproduction L-200s were powered by 120kW (160hp) Walter Minor 6-III inline sixes. Initial production was of the L-200A, which differed from the L-200 in being powered by two 155kW (210hp) fuel injected M-337s, and had greater weights, a reprofiled cabin and hydraulically (rather than electrically) operated undercarriage and flaps. Let built 160 L-200As before production switched to the improved L-200D. Features include a strengthened undercarriage, improved hydraulic and electrical systems and constant speed three blade propellers. The L-200D remained in production until 1969, and 5 aircraft were licence built in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) by Libis. A turboprop powered development was studied but not built. Most L-200 production was for customers within the Soviet Bloc - Aeroflot for example operated a large number in a range of roles including air taxi, air ambulance and communications duties. However small numbers were exported to western Europe, the USA and other Western countries.",
