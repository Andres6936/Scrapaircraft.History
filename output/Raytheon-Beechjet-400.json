  "history": "The Raytheon Beechjet traces its origins back to the Mitsubishi Diamond 2 bizjet, which Beechcraft acquired the design and production rights to in the mid 1980s. The original Mitsubishi MU300 Diamond 1 flew for the first time in August 1978, powered by two 11.1kN (2500lb) P&WC JT15D4 turbofans. The subsequent Diamond 2 flew on June 20 1984, with the first production aircraft flying in January 1985. Only 11 Diamond 2s were built before Beech purchased the design and production rights, resulting in the Model 400 Beechjet. Beech reengined the Diamond 2 with P&WC JT15D5 turbofans, developed a new interior, and incorporated a number of other minor refinements. Deliveries of the Beechjet began in June 1986, with low rate production continuing until that model was replaced by the Model 400A, which was delivered from November 1990. The new 400A incorporated a number of improvements over its predecessor. A higher max takeoff weight and greater operating ceiling improved performance, while repositioning the rear fuselage fuel tank increased cabin volume. The flightdeck features Collins Pro Line 4 EFIS with three colour displays - two primary flight displays (PFDs) and a multifunction display (MFD) with a second MFD optional. Following customer feedback Raytheon developed a new luxury standard interior for the Beechjet which was introduced in 1996. The Beechjet 400A also serves as the basis for the military T-1 Jayhawk tanker and transport aircrew trainer - 180 were delivered between 1992 and 1997. The Japan Air Self Defence Force has also taken delivery of 12 T-400 aircrew trainers (Beechjet 400Ts).",
