  "history": "The Corsair and Conquest I, and the 441 Conquest II are the turboprop powered equivalents of the 421 Golden Eagle and 404 Titan respectively. <p>The Model 441 Conquest was the first to be developed, it was designed concurrently with the piston engined 404 Titan in the mid 1970s. Development was announced in November 1974, and the first flight occurred in August 1976. First customer deliveries were from September 1977. The 441 shares a common fuselage with the Titan, but has a longer span (bonded and wet) wing, a pressurised fuselage, and most significantly, Garrett TPE331 turboprop engines. A PT6A powered 441, designated the 435, flew during 1986, but it did not enter production. <p>The 425 Corsair meanwhile was introduced to the Cessna model lineup from 1980. Based on the Model 421 Golden Eagle, it differs from its donor aircraft in having turboprop engines (in this case PT6As). Design work on the Corsair began in 1977, first flight was on September 12 1978 and first production deliveries took place in November 1980. <p>From 1983 Cessna renamed the Corsair the Conquest I, while the Conquest became the Conquest II. Production of both ceased in 1986. <p>The French built Reims Cessna F406 Caravan II meanwhile is something of a hybrid, incorporating 373kW (500shp) PT6A112s, the unpressurised fuselage of the Titan and the Conquest II's wings. First delivered in late 1984, the Caravan II is the only Cessna turboprop twin currently in production. <p>",
