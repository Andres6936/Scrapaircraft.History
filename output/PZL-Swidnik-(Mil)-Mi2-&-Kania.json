  "history": "Poland's most successful helicopter was originally developed in Russia by Mil, and in its Allison powered Kania (Kitty Hawk) version has achieved US certification. Mil originally designed the light utility Mi2 in Russia during the early 1960s, resulting in a first flight in September 1961. In January 1964 an agreement between the USSR and Poland transferred development and production to the latter country, which commenced in 1965. The Mi2 evolved since that time and remained in low rate production into the 1990s. The main civil variant is simply designated Mi2, Swidnik also developed a diverse number of military variants. The Kania (Kitty Hawk) is a substantial upgrade of the basic Mi2, and features Allison 250C20B turboshafts, western avionics, composite main and tail rotor blades, and has won US FAR Pt 29 certification. Developed in cooperation with Allison, the Kania first flew on June 3 1979, and US certification was granted in February 1986. The Kania has never entered full scale production but remains on offer, both as new build aircraft and as an upgrade of existing Mi2s.",
