  "history": "The MD-90 is the largest member of the Douglas/McDonnell Douglas/Boeing DC-9/MD-80/MD-90/717 family, and is a stretched, IAE V2500 powered development of the MD-80. The MD-90 program was launched in November 1988, first flight occurred on February 22 1993, and certification was awarded on November 16 1994. Launch customer was Delta, which has 31 on firm order, while other major customers include Saudi Arabian Airlines and Japan Air System. Most important of the changes introduced on the MD-90 are the two V2500 turbofans. At 111kN (25,000lb) thrust on the MD-90-30, the V2500s are the largest, heaviest and most powerful engines to be rear mounted on any airliner yet. More importantly though, the V2500 is highly regarded for its efficiency and fuel economy. Other changes to the MD-90 include the 1.4m (4ft 6in) fuselage stretch forward of the wing, allowing seating for an extra 10 passengers (in a two class arrangement). The stretch is forward of the wing to compensate for the extra weight of the engines. The MD-90 also features an EFIS glass flightdeck based on that in the MD88, and other detail improvements such as a revised passenger interior. The basic MD-90 model is the MD-90-30 (Chinese built Trunkliners are designated the MD-90-30T and feature double bogey main landing gear). It is also offered in MD-90-30ER extended range form with extra fuel. The MD-90 has also been offered as the 50, a further extended range version with a higher maximum takeoff weight and extra fuel and the MD-90-55 high capacity variant capable of seating 187 in a single class with two extra doors in the forward fuselage to meet emergency evacuation requirements. Following the 1997 merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, Boeing decided to cancel MD-90 production once outstanding orders were fulfilled. The last of 114 US-built Md-90s was completed in 2000.",
