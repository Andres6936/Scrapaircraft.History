  "history": "The An-24 is the original aircraft in a prolific and highly successful family of twin turboprop civil and military transports. The An-24 first flew in April 1960 with first production versions entering Aeroflot service in September 1963. Aeroflot was the largest An-24 operator, with others going to Soviet client nations. Subsequent production versions of the An-24 were the An-24B and the An-24T freighter. A small turbojet in the right engine nacelle to boost takeoff performance resulted in the An-24RT and An-24RV. The An-24P firebomber was also developed before Ukrainian production ceased in 1978. The An-24 was also developed into the An-26 \"Curl\" military tactical transport with more powerful engines and redesigned tail, which itself evolved into the An-32 with enhancements for better hot and high performance. Over 550 An-26s are in civil service. The An-30 development has been produced in limited numbers and is used largely for aerial survey and cartography work. This version is identifiable by its extensive nose glazing. The An-32 first flew in 1976 and features much more powerful 3760kW (5042ehp) Progress engines for improved hot and high performance. The An-32 features above wing mounted engines to give the larger diameter props adequate ground clearance. China's Xian Aircraft Manufacturing Company is now the sole production source for the An-24 as the Y-7. The Y-7-100 incorporates a number of modifications including a revised passenger interior and flightdeck, and wingtip winglets. It was developed with the technical assistance of HAECO in Hong Kong during the 1980s.",
