  "history": "The Piper PA-25 Pawnee was one of the first single seat light aircraft to be specifically designed and built for agricultural spraying and dusting. It was also one of the most successful, with several thousand built, and with licence production in a number of countries. The PA-25 Pawnee was originally designed by Fred Weick as the AG-3, and flew in prototype form during 1957. The design was originally powered by a 110kW (150hp) Lycoming O-320, the fuselage structure was designed to absorb impact forces in a crash, the high cockpit had excellent all round vision, the braced wing was fitted with spray bars, while a jump seat could be fitted in the hopper. Initial production was of the 110kW (150hp) powered Pawnee, which was delivered from August 1959. This was replaced by the 175kW (235hp) powered PA-25-235, and from 1968 the 195kw (260hp) PA-25-260 was available. The Pawnee B (235hp) introduced an enlarged hopper, the Pawnee C (235 or 260hp) followed with oleo type shock absorbers, while the ultimate Pawnee model, the Pawnee D (235 or 260hp) had the fuel tank moved from the fuselage to the wing. Production ceased in 1982. Many Pawnees have nowadays found their way to a glider airflield where they are very popular as glider tugs due to their good power/weight ratio.",
