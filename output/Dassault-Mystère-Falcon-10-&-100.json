  "history": "The baby of Dassault's corporate jet lineup, the Falcon 10 and Falcon 100 series (Myst\u00e8re 10 and Myst\u00e8re 100 in France) sold in good numbers during a production run that lasted almost two decades. <p>In concept a scaled down Falcon/Myst\u00e8re 20, the Falcon 10/100 was an all new design except for similar wing high lift devices. Conceived in the late 1960s, the Falcon 10 was the second member of the Dassault Falcon family to be developed. Dassault originally intended the Falcon 10 be powered by two General Electric CJ610 turbojets, and a CJ610 powered prototype first flew on December 1 1970. <p>Flight testing was delayed until May 1971 while changes were made to the wing design, including increasing the wing sweepback angle. The second prototype was the first to be powered by Garrett TFE731 turbofans, and it completed its first flight on October 15 1971. Flight testing was completed with the aid of a third prototype, and French and US certification was awarded in September 1973. Deliveries of production aircraft began that November. <p>While almost all Falcon 10 production was for civil customers, the French navy ordered seven, designated the Myst\u00e8re 10 MER, as multi purpose pilot trainers. Missions include simulation of targets for Super Etendard pilots and instrument training. <p>The improved Falcon 100 replaced the Falcon 10 in production in the mid 1980s. Certificated in December 1986, changes include an optional early EFIS glass cockpit, a higher maximum takeoff weight, a fourth cabin window on the right side and a larger unpressurised rear baggage compartment. <p>Production of the Falcon 100 ceased in 1990 with the last delivered that September. <p>",
