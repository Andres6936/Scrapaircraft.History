  "history": "The piston powered Y-11 and turboprop Y-12 are Chinese developed regional airliners and utility transports. Design of the Type 11 Transport Aircraft, or Yunshuji 11 (Y-11) began during the mid 1970s as a replacement for the Antonov An-2 utility biplane in Chinese service (licence built in China as the Y-5). A prototype was built and flown at Shenyang in 1975, while pre series and production aircraft are built at what is now the Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Company. Production Y-11s were built from 1980. Features include two radial engines, capability for rough field operations and STOL performance. Y-11s have seen service as commuter airliners and have also been configured and used for ag spraying. The Y-11B is an improved development powered by Teledyne Continental engines to overcome single engine altitude performance shortfalls. The first Y-11B's maiden flight was on December 25 1990. The Y-12 is a turboprop powered development and has been built in greater numbers than the Y-11. Work on a turboprop powered Y-11 began in the early 1980s, and a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A powered and enlarged cabin Y-12 prototype (previously the Y-11T) flew for the first time on August 16 1984. Current production is of the Y-12-II, while the further improved Y-12-IV was granted US certification in March 1995. Canadian Aerospace Group (CAG) and its Panda Aircraft Company subsidiary offers a developed Y-12 as the Twin Panda, which it aims at the twin Otter replacement market. The Twin Panda is based on the Y-12-IV but features more powerful PT6A-34 engines, strengthened landing gear, and upgraded avionics and interior. Production Twin Pandas will be built in China and outfitted in Canada prior to delivery. In 2000 Canadian Aerospace group said it had orders for 35 Twin Pandas.",
