  "history": "Piper's PA-24 Comanche was a high performance retractable undercarriage single designed to challenge the established high performance Beech Bonanza. Piper's first low wing single engine design, the Comanche featured a retractable tricycle undercarriage, swept back tail, flying tail or \"stabilator\" horizontal tail surfaces, laminar flow wing and all metal construction, a stark contrast to Piper's earlier high wing fabric covered designs. The Comanche first flew on May 24 1956 and was delivered to customers from late 1957 in PA-24-180 form. Since then through to the cessation of production in June 1972 (due to flooding of Piper's Lock Haven plant), a number of progressively higher performance variants were released. These included 1958's 185kW (250hp) PA-24-250 and the 300kW (400hp) PA-24-400. Just 148 400s were built, despite Piper claiming it to be the fastest production four seat single available at the time. Its massive eight cylinder IO-720 engine consumed fuel at a prodigious rate, meaning that it was expensive to operate, and there were problems with cooling the rear cylinders. Today however it has something of a mini cult status. Following the PA-24-400 was the PA-24-260 from 1964, with a 195kW (260hp) O-540 or IO-540, and finally the Rajay turbocharger fitted PA-24-260 Turbo C, available from 1970.",
