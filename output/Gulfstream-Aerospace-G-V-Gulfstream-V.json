  "history": "The Gulfstream V is the largest and latest development of the Gulfstream line of corporate transports, designed to fly intercontinental distances. It competes with Bombardier's Global Express, the Boeing Business Jet and Airbus A319CJ. Gulfstream Aerospace first announced it was studying a stretched ultra long range corporate transport based on the Gulfstream IV at the annual NBAA convention in October 1989, while the program was officially launched at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow. First flight was on November 28 1995, with certification and first deliveries planned for late 1996. Provisional FAA certification was awarded in December 1996, full certification was granted in April 1997. The first customer delivery was on July 1 1997. Underscoring its high speed, long range abilities, by September 1997 the G-V had set no less than 36 world city pair, class time to climb and altitude records. The Gulfstream V is based on the Gulfstream IV, but features a number of substantial changes to suit its different design objectives. The most obvious change is the stretched fuselage, the G-V is 2.49m (8ft 2in) longer overall than the G-IV. Perhaps the most important changes though are the advanced new wing design and new BMW Rolls-Royce BR-710 turbofans (the G-V is the first application for the new BR-710 engine). The all new wing is being built by Northrop Grumman, and is optimised for high speed flight. It was developed using Computer Aided Design and NASA developed computational fluid dynamics. The flightdeck is built around a six screen Honeywell EFIS avionics suite Wing manufacturer Vought Aircraft Industries and Japan's ShinMaywa are also risk sharing partners in the GV program.",
  "name": "Gulfstream Aerospace G-V Gulfstream V",
  "production": "More than 75 G-V orders held, including two ordered by the US Air Force as C-37s. Over 35 delivered by late 1998. A Gulfstream V delivered in September 1997 was the 1000th Gulfstream built."
