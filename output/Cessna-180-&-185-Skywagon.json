  "history": "The 180 started life as a more powerful development of the 170, and evolved into a family of useful utility aircraft that was in production for over three decades. The first 180s were essentially Model 170s with a more powerful 170kW (225hp) O-470-A engine. The first of the type flew in 1952 and deliveries began in February the following year. The 180's career as a high performance single was short lived due to the arrival of the tricycle 180 based 182 in 1956, but by then the type had established itself a useful niche as a utility aircraft. Progressive updating of the line led to a range of updated models including the 170kW (230hp) 180A, and 1964's 180G with a third cabin window which from 1966 was offered as a six seater, by then having the same fuselage as the more powerful 185 Skywagon. The Skywagon name was applied to the 180 in 1969. The 180 remained in production until 1981. The first 185 Skywagon flew in July 1960. It differed from the 180 in having a more powerful engine (195kW/260hp) and larger cabin, allowing six seats. Updated models include the 225kW (300hp) A185E from 1967 and the AgCarryall capable of chemical spraying.",
