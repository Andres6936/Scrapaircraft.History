  "history": "Although largely in operation with military air arms as a basic trainer, small numbers of the FFA Bravo are also in civilian hands, used primarily as aerobatic and basic pilot trainers. Design of the Bravo dates back to the late 1960s, with original design work undertaken by SIAI-Marchetti of Italy, but with production and subsequent development work the responsibility of FFA (a company originally established by Dornier as its Swiss subsidiary). The first prototype to fly was Swiss built, it took to the air for the first time on March 7 1969. An Italian built prototype followed soon after on May 7, while the first production standard aircraft flew on December 22 1971. Initial production concentrated on the AS-202/15 and 34 were built through to the early 1980s. The definitive production model was the AS-202/18A-4, which first flew in August 1974 and received its certification in late 1975. This version differs from the original 15 in having a more powerful 135kW (180hp) engine. The principle civil Bravo operator was British Aerospace Flight Training (Prestwick) in Scotland which operated 11 (named Wrens). One crashed, but the remaining 10 were sold to Finland where they now fly with Pilot Factory Flight Training (Helsinki). Two other models have been developed, although single aircraft of each have flown only. The first was the 195kW (260hp) Textron Lycoming AEIO-540 powered Bravo AS-202/26A, which first flew in 1979, the second was the 240kW (320shp) Allison 250-B17C turbine powered Bravo AS-202/32TP which flew in 1991. Swiss certification was awarded in 1995. The Bravo is still offered for sale although none have been delivered since 1989. In the absence of Bravo production FFA builds components for other manufacturers under subcontract.",
