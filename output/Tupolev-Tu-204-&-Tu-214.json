  "history": "The Tupolev Tu-204 is a medium range narrowbody twinjet and was the first Russian airliner to fly with western engines. Tupolev began development of the Tu-204 to meet an Aeroflot requirement for a replacement for the medium range Tu-154 trijet. This all new twin featured a supercritical wing, while engine designer Soloviev (now Aviadvigatel) specifically developed the PS-90 turbofan. Other Tu-204 design features include fly-by-wire and a six screen EFIS flightdeck. First flight was on January 2, 1989. The Tu-204 is offered in a number of models. The base model is the Tu-204, while the Tu-204-100 and -200 have higher max takeoff weights, more fuel and greater range. The Tu-204C and Tu-204-100C are freighters fitted with a forward main deck freight door. The Tu-214, Tu-214C combi convertible model, and Tu-214C freighter are manufactured in Kazan. Tupolev was keen to develop a westernised development of the Tu-204 to broaden the type's market appeal, resulting in the RollsRoyce RB211-535 powered Tu-204-120, which first flew on August 14, 1992. All but the first five feature Honeywell's VIA 2000 EFIS avionics suite. Rolls-Royce powered variants include the Tu-204-120C freighter, increased weight -220 and equivalent cargo -220C, and the -222 with Collins avionics. Air Cairo of Egypt became the launch operator when it took delivery of a Tu-204-120 and -120C in November 1998. Tupolev also developed two developments of the shortened 166-seater Tu-204-300, an RB211-535E4 powered model and a 158kN (35,580lb) PS90P powered model (also known as the Tu-234). The Tu-204-300 prototype (converted from the Tu-204 prototype) was publicly displayed at the 1995 Moscow Airshow. Other proposed developments include a Pratt & Whitney PW2240 powered model, a business jet and a maritime patrol platform.",
