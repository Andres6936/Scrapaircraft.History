  "history": "The MD-11 is a modernised, slightly stretched and re-engined development of the DC-10 trijet. Launched on December 30 1986 (following a launch order from British Caledonian for three placed earlier that month), the MD-11 was the result of a two year study to find a replacement for the DC-10. First flight occurred on January 10 1990, certification was granted in November that year, and the first one was delivered on December 7 1990 to Finnair. Compared to the DC-10, the MD-11 features a 5.71m (18ft 9in) fuselage stretch, winglets, modified tail with less sweepback, an advanced two crew six screen EFIS flightdeck, restyled main cabin interior and new engine options. Variants offered were the longer range MD-11ER available from early 1996, MD-11F freighter, MD-11C Combi and MD-11CF convertible passenger/freighter models. McDonnell Douglas at various times proposed MD-11 developments aimed at increasing seating through stretches and underfloor panorama deck seating. In 1996 MDC looked closely at the MD-XX, MD-11 variants with a new wing. Two versions were proposed, one with the standard MD-11 fuselage and a 15,565km (8400nm) range, the other a stretched 375 seater. These were not launched. In November 1997 following the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas merger Boeing announced that the MD-11 would be retained in production, primarily as a freighter. However in June 1998 Boeing reversed that decision, saying that due to a lack of market demand production would be wound up. The last MD-11 built, a MD-11F for Lufthansa cargo, was delivered February 22 2001.",
