  "history": "The successful DC-8 Super 60 airliners are stretched developments of the DC-8 Series 50. The Super 70s are Super 60s re-engined with CFM56 high bypass turbofans. Douglas announced the DC-8 Super Sixty series in April 1965. The first, a DC-8-61, took to the skies for the first time on March 14 1966, followed by the first flights of the DC-8-62 on August 29 1966 and the DC-8-63 on April 10 1967. The DC-8-61 differed from the earlier DC-8-50 in having two fuselage plugs which increased length by 11.18m (36ft 8in), increasing max seating capacity to 259 (the largest of any single aisle airliner prior to the 757-300) and underfloor freight capacity by 80%. Intended for domestic operations, its max takeoff weight was identical to the DC-8-50. The Super 62 was intended for long range operations and featured only a modest 2.04m (6ft 8in) stretch compared to the Series 50, greater wing span, revised engine nacelles and pylons and significantly increased fuel capacity. The Super 63 meanwhile combined the DC-8-61's fuselage with the DC-8-62's wings. It was the final DC-8 variant in production, and the last was delivered in May 1972. McDonnell Douglas initiated a re-engining program of Super 60 series aircraft with CFM International CFM56 engines in the early 1980s, known as the Super 70 Series. The first converted airframe flew in August 1981. The Super 70 aircraft are considerably quieter than their predecessors, with better fuel economy and greater range.",
