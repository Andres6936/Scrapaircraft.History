  "history": "The Hawker 1000 was the largest member of the DH/HS/BAe-125/Hawker 800 series of corporate jets. The Hawker 1000 was based on the smaller Hawker 800, and until 1997 the two types were in production side by side in the famous de Havilland plant in Hatfield. The 1000 differs from the 800 in a number of respects however and features a stretched fuselage. The 1000 is identifiable via its seven main cabin windows per side, whereas the 800 has six, and the 0.84m (2ft 9in) stretch (achieved by small fuselage plugs in front of and behind the wing) allowing an increase in max seating to 15. However as it is optimised for long range intercontinental work, the typical Hawker 1000 configuration seats one less than the smaller Hawker 800. Other important changes include Pratt & Whitney Canada PW-305 turbofans (in place of the AlliedSignal TFE-731 on the Hawker 800), extra fuel in the extended forward wing fairing, new lightweight systems, revised and more efficient cabin interior with increased headroom, EFIS cockpit and certification to the latest US FAR and European JAR requirements. British Aerospace launched the BAe-125-1000 program in October 1989. The first BAe-125-1000 development aircraft first flew on June 16 1990, with a second following on November 26 that year. These two were followed by the first production aircraft which participated in an 800 hour flight test development program, culminating in UK certification being granted on October 21 1991 (FAA certification followed on October 31 1991). The first production aircraft was delivered in December 1991. As is the case with the BAe-125-800, the BAe-125-1000 became the Hawker 1000 from mid 1993 when Raytheon purchased British Aerospace's Corporate Jets division. However, the 1000 never enjoyed the popularity of the 800 and production ceased in 1997 with the delivery of the 52nd aircraft. The 1000's largest customer is Executive Jet Aviation (including the NetJets fractional ownership program), which early 2002 has 27 in service (including 13 of the last 14 built).",
