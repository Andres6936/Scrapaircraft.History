  "history": "The 412 family is a development of the 212, the major change being an advanced smaller diameter four blade main rotor in place of the 212's two blade unit. Development of the 412 began in the late 1970s and two 212s were converted to the new standard to act as development aircraft for the program. The first of these flew in August 1979, and the 412 was awarded VFR certification in January 1981. That same month the first delivery occurred. Subsequent development led to the 412SP, or Special Performance, with increased fuel capacity, higher takeoff weight and more optional seating arrangements. The 412HP, or High Performance, superseded the 412SP in production in 1991. Features include improved transmission for better hovering performance. The current standard production model is the 412EP, or Enhanced Performance. The 412EP features a PT6T3D engine and a dual digital automatic flight control system fitted as standard, with optional EFIS displays. Fixed tricycle landing gear is optional. Meanwhile in Indonesia, IPTN has a licence to build the 412SP, which it calls the NBell412. IPTN has a licence to build up to 100 NBell412s. Like the 212, the 412 is in widespread use for a number of utility roles, including EMS and oil rig support, its twin engine configuration being an asset, particularly in the latter role. It too is in military service, Canada once again being a major customer (including 100 recently delivered 412EP based CH-146 Griffons).",
  "name": "Bell 412",
  "production": "Over 420 Bell 412s of all models, civil and military, have been built. Production of the 412 switched to Bell's Canadian plant in February 1989."
