  "history": "The Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante, or `Bandit', remains Embraer's most successful commercial aircraft program. Design of the EMB-110 was undertaken in response to a Brazilian Ministry of Aeronautics specification for a general purpose light transport suitable for military and civilian duties. The new design was developed with the assistance of well known French designer Max Holste, and the first of three YC-95 prototypes flew for the first time on October 26 1968. Embraer (or Empresa Brasilera de Aeronautica SA) was established the following year, and development and production of the C95 became one of the company's first responsibilities. The first production standard EMB-110 Bandeirante (Portuguese for Pioneer) flew on August 9 1972, and the first entered airline service in April 1973. Bandeirante models include the 12 seat transport EMB-110, the aerial photography EMB-110B and maritime patrol EMB-111 for the Brazilian air force; the initial airline version, the 15 seat EMB-110C; the seven seat EMB110E executive transport; 18 seat enlarged EMB-110P; convertible passenger/freight EMB110P1 with larger rear door; the EMB-110PA which replaced the 110P as the standard passenger aircraft from 1983 and introduced dihedral to the tailplane among other minor improvements; the EMB-110P1K and EMB-110K SAR military equivalents to the P1A; the EMB-110P2 commuter with seating for up to 21; the EMB-110P2A which replaced the P2 and introduced the same changes as the P1A; and the EMB-110P1A/41 and EMBP2A/41 versions of the P1A and P2A recertificated to US FAA SFAR41 standards with higher weights. Production of the Bandeirante ceased in May 1990, the final aircraft being delivered to the Brazilian Air Force. Today the Bandeirante's virtues of reliability and good operating economics means that it remains popular with its operators.",
