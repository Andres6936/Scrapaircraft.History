  "history": "A larger development of the Puma (described under Aerospatiale), the Super Puma is a practical and proven medium lift twin helicopter, particularly popular for offshore oil rig support work. The original SA 330 Puma, on which the Super Puma is based, flew for the first time in April 1965. The first Super Puma first flew in September 1978 and was essentially a more powerful version of the Puma, featuring 1270kW (1700shp) Turbom\u00e9ca Makila turboshafts, new avionics, composite rotor blades and an enlarged fuselage. For a time Aerospatiale planned to fit the Super Puma with a Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, but testing revealed no significant performance benefits. Commercial versions were designated AS 332Cs. The AS 332L (or SA 332L before 1980) Super Puma introduced a stretched fuselage (by 76.5cm/2.5ft), first flew on October 10 1980 and was certificated in 1983. The updated AS 332L1 with Makila 1A1 engines appeared in 1986. Bristow Helicopters ordered 31 specially customised AS 332Ls for its North Sea offshore oil rig work, and these are named Tiger. The AS 332L remains in production but is progressively being replaced by the AS 332L2. The L2 Super Puma Mk II (known as the Cougar in military guise) features a further fuselage stretch permitting a further row of seats, EFIS flight instrumentation, spheriflex rotor heads and longer main rotor blades with parabolic tips. It was certificated in 1992.",
